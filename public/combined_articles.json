IX Reservations to the Genocide Convention Are Here To Stay: A Response to Diamond\n14.03.25\n|\n0 Comments\n[Michael A Becker is Assistant Professor of International and European Human Rights Law at Trinity College Dublin]\nOn 5 March 2025,\nSudan instituted proceedings\nagainst the United Arab Emirates (UAE) at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in relation to alleged violations of the\n1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide\n. Based on allegations that UAE is supporting genocidal acts by the Rapid Support Forces in West Darfur against the Masalit group, Sudan’s claims raise important questions about the nature and scope of complicity in genocide. Nonetheless, it is very unlikely that any of these factual allegations or legal claims will be heard or decided by the ICJ. Because the UAE made a reservation to Article IX when it acceded to the Genocide Convention in 2005, the ICJ can be expected to conclude that it lacks jurisdiction over the dispute. Art. IX is the provision by which states consent to ICJ jurisdiction over disputes relating to the interpretation, application, or fulfilment of the treaty.\nThis makes the recent\nOpinio Juris\npost by Yonah Diamond\n(“The Invalidity of Art. IX Reservations to the Genocide Convention”\n) especially timely. Sudan has\nsuggested\nthat it will seek to challenge UAE’s Art. IX reservation on the basis such reservations are incompatible with the object and purpose of the Genocide Convention. This is also the argument that Diamond sets out to make. However, Diamond takes a normative position on the undesirability of Art. IX reservations that fails to take a full view of the relevant history surrounding the validity of such reservations or the doctrinal basis for preserving the status quo.\nDecades of practice at the ICJ support the view that Art. IX reservations are valid as a matter of treaty law. In 1951, the\nReservations to the Genocide Convention\nadvisory opinion established the principle that reservations are permissible unless incompatible with the treaty’s object and purpose. The question arose precisely because so many states that sought to join the newly-adopted Genocide Convention had made Art. IX reservations when doing so. The rule articulated by the ICJ (later codified in Article 19 of the\n1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties\n) paved the way for those reserving states to be considered parties to the Genocide Convention and confirmed the treaty’s entry into force. Ultimately, the Court treated reservations (including to Art IX) as the necessary cost to obtaining as wide a degree of participation as possible. In contentious cases since then, the Court has not questioned the validity of Art. IX reservations. Consider the Court’s acceptance of the validity of Art. IX reservations in the 1999\nLegality of Use of Force\ncases against\nSpain\nand the\nUnited States\n, as affirmed more recently in the\n5 June 2023 Order on the Admissibility of the Declarations of Intervention\nin\nUkraine v Russia\n(see paras 93-96).\nDiamond does briefly mention\nArmed Activities on the Territory of the Congo\n, where the ICJ in 2006 directly rejected the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s challenge to the validity of Rwanda’s Art. IX reservation (see paras 64-69) . In Diamond’s view, the Court ‘evidently erred’ in delineating the treaty’s object and purpose based on a substantive/procedural distinction and by failing to credit the jus cogens status of the genocide prohibition. One can disagree with the Court’s reasoning, but I don’t see how we can describe this as manifest error. Diamond’s argument seems to be that recourse to the ICJ is the only practical means to implement or enforce the Genocide Convention. Despite the uptick in ICJ cases relating to the Genocide Convention, this is not the case. In principle, acting pursuant to Article VIII of the Genocide Convention, states can turn to the UN General Assembly, the UN Security Council, or the UN Human Rights Council. Compliance might also be pursued through domestic courts or by recourse to countermeasures. Some states might also believe that the goals of the Genocide Convention are best pursued through international criminal law and, in particular, the International Criminal Court.\nIn short, a judgment by the ICJ is not the only means to seek to give effect to the substantive obligations set forth in the Genocide Convention. I am not claiming that any of these alternative methods is likely to be especially effective (or at least any more effective that ICJ litigation). But they exist, and I think the ICJ was correct in 2006 to note that opting out of ICJ dispute settlement does not inherently compromise the goal of preventing and punishing the crime of genocide (even if it might make prevention and accountability more difficult, and even if it is preferable for states to accept Art. IX).\nUltimately, Diamond is making a normative argument that Art. IX reservations should be deemed invalid, at least based on developments since the 2006 judgment in\nArmed Activities (DRC v Rwanda)\n. Yet from a doctrinal perspective, the fact that the ICJ has confirmed the standing of non-injured states to bring Genocide Convention cases (see, e.g., the\n2022 judgment on preliminary objections in The Gambia v Myanmar\n(paras 106-114)) does not bear on the validity of Art. IX reservations. The same goes for the phenomenon of “\nmass intervention\n” by third states in these cases. These notable trends are not sufficient to establish a peremptory norm of general international law “requiring a State to consent to the jurisdiction of the Court to settle a dispute relating to the Genocide Convention”, as the Court put it in\nArmed Activities\n(\npara 69\n). The fact that many states see the ICJ as an important and (maybe) useful way to seek compliance with the Genocide Convention does not in and of itself mean that Art. IX reservations are incompatible (or are no longer compatible) with the treaty’s broader goals.\nThis is not to say that the validity of Art. IX reservations has not been contentious (including among ICJ judges), and Diamond notes correctly that some states have lodged objections to Art. IX reservations at various times. However, the majority of states parties to the Genocide Convention have not done so (including Sudan, which did not object to UAE’s Art. IX objection at the relevant time). Whether state practice of this sort should be the ultimate arbiter of a treaty’s object and purpose is debatable, but this record of tacit acceptance weighs against Diamond’s position.  Taking a broader view, it remains the case that most international human rights treaties treat third-party dispute settlement as optional (and sometimes make this explicit, as in Article 30(2) of the\n1984 Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment\n). Given the substantive similarities between the Genocide Convention and the Torture Convention, the optional nature of ICJ dispute settlement under the Torture Convention further undercuts the argument that Art. IX reservations are inherently incompatible with the object and purpose of the Genocide Convention.\nDiamond’s piece closes by describing Art. IX reservations as a technicality. This strikes me as unfortunate. It may be that some states parties to the Genocide Convention would never have ratified or acceded to the treaty without the possibility of excluding ICJ dispute settlement. If the ICJ were asked to address this question today (as may happen in the new proceedings instituted by Sudan), the ICJ would be wise to proceed in a manner consistent with its past practice—an approach that gives primacy to state consent. Indeed, this may be an especially inopportune moment to take steps that might further destabilize an\ninternational legal system already facing very serious threats and dramatic change\n.\nNone of this means that I endorse the possibility of giving states the option to withhold their consent to third-party dispute settlement as a general matter. In a world in which\ninternational affairs are far more judicialized\nthan they were in 1948, it should generally be feasible and good policy to treat the acceptance of compulsory dispute settlement as the ‘price of admission’ to human rights treaty regimes. But this neither can nor should undo decades of practice under the 1948 Genocide Convention, which has cemented the optional nature of ICJ dispute settlement under that instrument.\nTopics\nFeatured\n,\nGeneral\nShare\nEmail\nTwitter\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nWhatsApp\nPrint\nTags:\nGenocide Convention\n,\nICJ\n,\ntreaty reservation\nRelated\nLeave a Reply\nPlease\nLogin\nto comment\nThis comment form is under antispam protection\nThis comment form is under antispam protection\nSubscribe\nNotify of\nnew follow-up comments\nnew replies to my comments\nAbout Author\nMichael A Becker\nRecent Posts\nEvents and Announcements: 16 March 2025\nArt.

Sudan accused the UAE of complicity in alleged genocide against the Masalit ethnic group.\n\nThe complaint centres on the actions of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and allied militias, which Sudan alleges have committed acts of genocide, murder, theft, rape, forcible displacement and other human rights violations.\n\nSudan claims these acts were carried out with the direct support of the UAE, including the supply of weapons, artillery, ammunition, drones and other military equipment. Sudan further alleges the UAE sent its own agents and mercenaries to assist the RSF.\n\nThe complaint details the impact of the conflict, stating that violence has disrupted agricultural projects, factory production, and access to healthcare and education. Sudan alleges that the UAE's support for the RSF has led to the deaths of thousands of civilians, the displacement of millions, and the widespread destruction of property.\n\nSudan's case is based on Article 36, paragraph 1, of the ICJ Statute and Article IX of the Genocide Convention, to which both countries are signatories.\n\nThe UAE, however, made a reservation upon acceding to the Genocide Convention, seeking to exclude disputes under the Convention from the ICJ's jurisdiction. Sudan argues this reservation is invalid as it is incompatible with the Convention's object and purpose.\n\nAlongside the lawsuit, Sudan has requested the ICJ impose provisional measures to protect the Masalit population. These include an order for the UAE to cease all support for the RSF and to take steps to prevent further acts of genocide. Sudan argues for the urgency of these measures, citing the ongoing nature of the alleged genocide and the risk of irreparable harm.\n\nThe ICJ, also known as the World Court, has acknowledged the urgency and will prioritize Sudan's request for provisional measures.",

The violence, fueled by ethnic and tribal divisions, can be\ntraced back\nto the rule of former president Omar al-Bashir lasting from 1989 to 2019 before being ousted in a popular revolution. A fragile civilian-military coalition ensued but it soon collapsed under a military coup led by al-Burhan in October 2021.\nFollowing the coup, tensions increased between the military and the RSF, especially over plans to\nintegrate\nthe latter into the army. This\nculminated\non April 15, 2023, when RSF units launched coordinated attacks on SAF targets, including in key locations in the capital Khartoum, marking the beginning of the war.\nThe RSF, originally formed from the Janjaweed militias accused of atrocities in Darfur during the early 2000s, has been implicated in severe human rights violations, including attacks on the Masalit community in West Darfur.\nAccording to\ndata\nfrom the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED), by the end of November 2024, over 28,000 people have been killed, though some estimate that the real number is far higher and could be as high as\n150,000\n.\nRecent numbers from the International Organization for Migration\nestimate\nthat more than 14 million Sudanese have been displaced since the beginning of the fighting in April 2023, including more than 3.5 million who have crossed the borders to seek refuge in neighboring countries. That is almost 30 percent of the total population of the country with\nhalf\nthe population in need of humanitarian help.\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) has accused both warring parties of bombing populated areas indiscriminately, with RSF “deliberately targeting hospitals,”\naccording\nto Mohamed Osman, researcher for their Africa division.\nThe UAE's role in other conflicts\nBeyond Sudan, the UAE has faced scrutiny for its involvement in various regional conflicts. In Yemen, the UAE has been a key member of the Saudi-led coalition against Houthi rebels, a campaign\ncriticized\nfor causing civilian casualties and a humanitarian disaster.\nAdditionally, reports have emerged of the UAE\nsupplying\narms to factions in Libya, further destabilizing the region. These actions have raised concerns about the UAE's adherence to international law and its role in perpetuating conflicts across West Asia and North Africa.​\nThe UAE's relationship with Israel has evolved significantly since the signing of the\nAbraham Accords\nin 2020, normalizing relations between the two countries. Despite Israel's military actions in Gaza, which have been described as a genocide by various\nexperts\nand\nhuman rights organizations\nand ruled as a\nplausible\ncase of genocide by the ICJ, the UAE has\nmaintained\nand expanded its diplomatic, economic and military ties with Israel, including helping Israel\nbypass\nthe naval blockade through setting up a route from Dubai to Haifa.\nIn February this year, a video of the UAE ambassador to the US saying that he saw “no alternative” to Donald Trump’s plan to ethnically cleanse Gaza’s Palestinian population caused outrage.\nThe UAE ambassador to the US said on Wednesday that he saw “no alternative” to Trump’s plan to expel Gaza’s population and redevelop the strip.\nThough the prospect of ethnic cleansing caused global outrage, the UAE called it “difficult” but pointed to a lack of other options.\npic.twitter.com/Zsbg4yjJcZ\n— Middle East Eye (@MiddleEastEye)\nFebruary 13, 2025\nChallenges to the ICJ\nSudan's case against the UAE at the ICJ highlights the complexities of international relations and the growing challenges of holding states accountable for their involvement in foreign conflicts. This comes at a time of\nunprecedented\nviolence and\nimpunity\n, as international law and institutions face systematic\nerosion\nsince the establishment of the UN.\nIn March 2025, the ICJ\nelected\nJapanese judge Yuji Iwasawa as its new president. The Sudan vs. UAE case coincides with another major genocide accusation at the court — South Africa's case against Israel over its actions in Gaza. It is the\nseventh\ngenocide case brought before the ICJ, two of which pertain to the ongoing war in Gaza.\nThe outcome of Sudan’s case against the UAE could set a significant precedent for international law, particularly regarding state complicity in human rights violations. As proceedings unfold, the international community will closely watch how the ICJ navigates these complex legal and ethical issues amid growing\nattacks\non international institutions and courts, particularly from the US and\nsome\nof its allies.\nCategories\nRegions\nSub-Saharan Africa\nWest Asia & North Africa\nSudan\nUnited Arab Emirates\nTopics\nHuman Rights\nHumanitarian Response\nInternational Relations\nPolitics\nWar & Conflict\nA region on the brink: The global implications of the war on Gaza\nWritten by\nWalid El Houri\nSupport our work\nGlobal Voices\nstands out as one of the earliest and strongest examples of how media committed to building community and defending human rights can positively influence how people experience events happening beyond their own communities and national borders.\nPlease consider making a donation to help us continue this work.\nDonate now\nRecent Sub-Saharan Africa Stories\nAfrican Union: Mahmoud Ali Youssouf elected as new commission chairperson\nWritten by\nJean Sovon\nTranslated by\nLaura\n11 hours ago\nTackling adolescent malnutrition in Nigeria’s internally displaced persons (IDP) camps\nWritten by\nAdesewa Olofinko\n2 days ago\nQ&A: Meet Musah Fuseini, Dagbani language activist\nWritten by\nSubhashish Panigrahi\n3 days ago\nMore »\nTop World Stories\nHow the Income Tax department’s actions undermine India’s democratic foundations\nWritten by\nKanav Narayan Sahgal\n2 days ago\nFrom visa-free to visa fees, the UK's new requirements for Trinidad & Tobago nationals stir debate\nWritten by\nJanine Mendes-Franco\n3 days ago\nFour key points to understand El Salvador in 2025\nWritten by\nValeria Cortez\nTranslated by\nMelissa Vida\n4 days ago\nCancel this reply\nStart the conversation\nAuthors, please\nlog in »\nName (required)\nEmail (will not be published) (required)\nWebsite\nSubscribe to comments on this post via email\nGuidelines\nAll comments are reviewed by a moderator\n.

    "cleaned_text_content": "Another test for international justice: Sudan takes the UAE to the ICJ over its complicity in genocide\n\nWritten by Walid El Houri\nPosted 15 March 2025 17:57 GMT\n\nScreenshot from video uploaded to X.com by user @Aleisir on October 8, 2024 showing UAE ammunition captured by the SAF. Fair use.\n\nOn March 6, 2025, Sudan initiated legal proceedings against the United Arab Emirates (UAE) at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), accusing the UAE of breaching the Genocide Convention by supporting the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group implicated in atrocities against the Masalit people in Sudan's West Darfur region. The UAE has denied the accusations.\n\nHistorical accusations\n\nThe allegations against the UAE are not isolated. In October 2024, the RSF mistakenly shot down a military plane in Sudan's Malha region, killing two Russian crew members and three Sudanese on board. The Conflict Observatory identified the aircraft as an Ilyushin Il-76, affiliated with Kyrgyzstan's New Way Cargo, suggesting involvement in arms shipments from the UAE to the RSF. Identity documents found at the crash site included a passport and an ID of a Russian linked to a UAE-based company, Airline Transport Incorporation FZC. ​\n\nPrior to this incident the Sudanese government had been repeatedly accusing the UAE of arming the RSF and prolonging the war while profiting from “the illegal exploitation of gold.”\n\nIn October 2024, Khalid Ali Aleisir, Minister of Culture and Information in Sudan shared a video of what he claimed was evidence of UAE supplying weapons to the RSF:\n\nFollowing their victory and control over the Jebel Moya area, the Sudanese Armed Forces discovered Emirati military equipment supplied to the rebel militia, along with various types of Emirati weapons, ammunition, and medical supplies.\nNew evidence reveals the UAE's involvement…\npic.twitter.com/975qKLHJdK\n— Khalid Ali خالد علي (الإعيسر) (@Aleisir) October 8, 2024\n\nContext of the war\n\nThe almost two-year-long round of violence is the fourth civil war in the country’s history. The violence, fueled by ethnic and tribal divisions, can be traced back to the rule of former president Omar al-Bashir lasting from 1989 to 2019 before being ousted in a popular revolution. A fragile civilian-military coalition ensued but it soon collapsed under a military coup led by al-Burhan in October 2021.\n\nFollowing the coup, tensions increased between the military and the RSF, especially over plans to integrate the latter into the army. This culminated on April 15, 2023, when RSF units launched coordinated attacks on SAF targets, including in key locations in the capital Khartoum, marking the beginning of the war.\n\nThe RSF, originally formed from the Janjaweed militias accused of atrocities in Darfur during the early 2000s, has been implicated in severe human rights violations, including attacks on the Masalit community in West Darfur.\n\nAccording to data from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED), by the end of November 2024, over 28,000 people have been killed, though some estimate that the real number is far higher and could be as high as 150,000.\n\nRecent numbers from the International Organization for Migration estimate that more than 14 million Sudanese have been displaced since the beginning of the fighting in April 2023, including more than 3.5 million who have crossed the borders to seek refuge in neighboring countries. That is almost 30 percent of the total population of the country with half the population in need of humanitarian help.\n\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) has accused both warring parties of bombing populated areas indiscriminately, with RSF “deliberately targeting hospitals,” according to Mohamed Osman, researcher for their Africa division.\n\nThe UAE's role in other conflicts\n\nBeyond Sudan, the UAE has faced scrutiny for its involvement in various regional conflicts. In Yemen, the UAE has been a key member of the Saudi-led coalition against Houthi rebels, a campaign criticized for causing civilian casualties and a humanitarian disaster.\n\nAdditionally, reports have emerged of the UAE supplying arms to factions in Libya, further destabilizing the region. These actions have raised concerns about the UAE's adherence to international law and its role in perpetuating conflicts across West Asia and North Africa.​\n\nThe UAE's relationship with Israel has evolved significantly since the signing of the Abraham Accords in 2020, normalizing relations between the two countries. Despite Israel's military actions in Gaza, which have been described as a genocide by various experts and human rights organizations and ruled as a plausible case of genocide by the ICJ, the UAE has maintained and expanded its diplomatic, economic and military ties with Israel, including helping Israel bypass the naval blockade through setting up a route from Dubai to Haifa.\n\nIn February this year, a video of the UAE ambassador to the US saying that he saw “no alternative” to Donald Trump’s plan to ethnically cleanse Gaza’s Palestinian population caused outrage.\n\nThe UAE ambassador to the US said on Wednesday that he saw “no alternative” to Trump’s plan to expel Gaza’s population and redevelop the strip. Though the prospect of ethnic cleansing caused global outrage, the UAE called it “difficult” but pointed to a lack of other options. pic.twitter.com/Zsbg4yjJcZ — Middle East Eye (@MiddleEastEye) February 13, 2025\n\nChallenges to the ICJ\n\nSudan's case against the UAE at the ICJ highlights the complexities of international relations and the growing challenges of holding states accountable for their involvement in foreign conflicts. This comes at a time of unprecedented violence and impunity, as international law and institutions face systematic erosion since the establishment of the UN.\n\nIn March 2025, the ICJ elected Japanese judge Yuji Iwasawa as its new president. The Sudan vs. UAE case coincides with another major genocide accusation at the court — South Africa's case against Israel over its actions in Gaza. It is the seventh genocide case brought before the ICJ, two of which pertain to the ongoing war in Gaza.\n\nThe outcome of Sudan’s case against the UAE could set a significant precedent for international law, particularly regarding state complicity in human rights violations. As proceedings unfold, the international community will closely watch how the ICJ navigates these complex legal and ethical issues amid growing attacks on international institutions and courts, particularly from the US and some of its allies.\n",

    "cleaned_text_content": "Sudan Takes UAE to ICJ Over Alleged Support for RSF in Civil War\n\nBy Sewuese Anyo\nMarch 7, 2025\n\n\nSudan has lodged a case against the United Arab Emirates (UAE) at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), accusing it of supporting the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the country’s ongoing civil war.\n\nKhartoum alleges that the UAE is “complicit in the genocide” of the Masalit community in West Darfur through its military, financial, and political backing of the RSF.\n\nThe UAE has firmly denied the accusations, dismissing the case as a “cynical publicity stunt” and vowing to seek its immediate dismissal.\n\nAn unnamed UAE official stated that Sudan’s claims “lack any legal or factual basis” and are an attempt to divert attention from the conflict’s devastation.\n\nSince the war began in April 2023, both the RSF and the Sudanese army have been accused of committing atrocities.  The RSF, in particular, has faced allegations of genocide against non-Arabic communities in Darfur. UN experts have previously deemed reports of the UAE smuggling weapons to the RSF via Chad as credible.\n\nThe war has resulted in immense suffering, with tens of thousands killed and over 12 million displaced.  This week, heavy shelling at a displacement camp in North Darfur left dozens feared dead. While the ICJ’s advisory opinion is not legally binding, it carries significant political weight.\n",

(Photo credit:  Martin Pope/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\nSOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\nOn March 5, 2025, Sudan\nfiled\nan\napplication\ninstituting proceedings against the United Arab Emirates (UAE) before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) with regard to a dispute concerning alleged violations by the UAE of its obligations under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Genocide Convention) in relation to the Masalit group in Sudan, most notably in West Darfur. The ICJ is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. The ICJ has a twofold role: first, to settle, in accordance with international law, legal disputes submitted to it by States; and, second, to give advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by duly authorized United Nations organs and agencies of the system.\nSudan’s application concerns “acts which have been perpetrated by (…) Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and militias allied with it, including, but not limited to, genocide, murder, theft of property, rape, forcible displacement, trespassing, vandalism of public properties, and violation of human rights.” According to the application, all such acts have been “perpetrated and enabled by the direct support given to the rebel RSF militia and related militia groups by the United Arab Emirates.” The application also concerns “acts adopted, condoned, taken, and being taken by the Government of the UAE in connection with the genocide against the Masalit group in the Republic of the Sudan since at least 2023.” Sudan submitted that the UAE “is complicit in the genocide on the Masalit through its direction of and provision of extensive financial, political, and military support for the rebel RSF militia.”\nThe Masalit are a small ethnic minority group in western Sudan (and also in Chad). The United Nations\nreported\non several attacks against the groups, including in November 2023, when hundreds of ethnic Masalit civilians were reportedly killed in Ardamata town, West Darfur, by the RSF and their allied Arab militia. The RSF has its roots in the Janjaweed militias, and some of its leaders\nface outstanding war crimes\nand atrocity crimes charges. Apart from mass killings, rape and other forms of sexual violence have been a common weapon of war against the ethnic minority group. In September 2024, the UN Independent International Fact-Finding Mission for the Sudan, a body specially established to examine the deteriorating situation in Sudan,\npublished\nits first report finding that “the horrific assaults carried by the RSF and its allies against non-Arab communities – in particular the Masalit in and around El Geneina, West Darfur – included killings, torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence, destruction of property and pillage.” Several human rights non-governmental organizations warned about the targeting of the group along ethnic lines. In 2024, Human Rights Watch published a 218-page report, “\nThe Massalit Will Not Come Home: Ethnic Cleansing and Crimes Against Humanity in El Geneina, West Darfur\n,” commenting on some of the evidence of the crimes against the community.\nThe possible involvement of the UAE was raised by the\nUN Panel of Experts on the Sudan\nin 2023 and 2024, however, it was denied by the UAE.\nSudan’s application alleges that “the UAE made available to the rebel RSF militia military, logistical, and all kinds of support, which in turn has enabled the rebel RSF militia to carry out its illegal acts amounting to genocide, and forced Sudanese civilian people to abandon their houses to save their lives and their dignity. In addition, the support of UAE led to a remarkable number of civilian houses and public properties being totally destroyed, including the targeted and widespread destruction of infrastructure.”\nMORE FOR YOU\nFBI Warns Chrome, Safari And Edge Users—Do Not Use These Websites\nYou Have 7 Days To Act Following Gmail Lockout Hack Attacks, Google Says\nNYT ‘Strands’ Today: Hints, Spangram And Answers For Monday, March 17th\nSudan’s application includes the request for provisional measures, including:\n“(1) The United Arab Emirates shall, in accordance with its obligations under the [Genocide Convention]\n, in relation to the Masalit in the Republic of the Sudan, take all measures within its power to prevent the commission of all acts within the scope of Article II of this Convention (…)\n(2) The United Arab Emirates shall, in relation to the members of the Masalit group, ensure that any irregular armed units which may be directed or supported by it and any organizations and persons which may be subject to its control, direction or influence, do not commit any acts described in point (1) above, or of conspiracy to commit genocide, of direct and public incitement to commit genocide, of attempts to commit genocide, or of complicity in genocide.”\nUAE rejected the allegations. UAE Foreign Minister Anwar Gargash\ncommented\n: “The priority in Sudan must be the ceasefire in this absurd, destructive war and to address the enormous humanitarian catastrophe.”\nThe ICJ has yet to identify further steps in the case and to adjudicate on the provisional measures.\nFollow me on\nTwitter\nor\nLinkedIn\n.\nCheck out\nmy\nwebsite\nor\nsome of my other work\n.\nEditorial Standards\nForbes Accolades\n© 2025 Forbes Media LLC.

Its population of 50 million has seen almost one-third of its people displaced during the civil war, which began in April 2023 and has led to widespread killing, hunger and disease.\n\nTens of thousands have died and more than three million are believed to have fled the violence. The U.N. has said Sudan is suffering the world's worst hunger crisis, affecting an estimated five million people.\n\nBoth sides of the conflict — government forces and the rebels — have committed atrocities against civilians, according to reports by the United Nations and other human rights groups.\n\nSudan took its complaint to the International Court of Justice on Tuesday.

Forensic evidence, including a\nreport\nfrom the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights and a separate Human Rights Watch\nreport\n, has detailed the RSF’s systematic killings, sexual violence, and incineration of whole villages in West Darfur. Satellite imagery analyzed by Yale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab\nexposes\nthe widespread destruction of civilian settlements.\nThe United Nations’ report on the\ndiscovery of mass graves\nfollowing RSF attacks further reinforces the evidence.\nSurvivor accounts\ndescribe RSF fighters targeting the Masalit for their ethnicity, chanting racial slurs while executing civilians, including children, which demonstrates clear evidence of genocidal intent. The U.S. State Department’s January\ndesignation\nof RSF actions as genocide, though tardy under the Biden administration, aligns with these findings.\nThe UAE’s role is not conjecture but a matter of meticulously documented fact. In January 2024, the U.N. Security Council’s Panel of Experts\nreported\ncredible evidence of UAE involvement and weapons supply to the RSF via its Amdjarass base in Chad.\nFlight tracking data and satellite images analyzed by the Conflict Observatory, a U.S. nongovernmental organization that verifies reports of war crimes in Sudan and Ukraine,\nconcluded\nwith “near certainty” that the UAE transferred weapons to the RSF. Reuters\nreported\nthat there were at least 86 flights from the UAE to Amdjarass since the war began, with three-quarters operated by carriers previously linked to arms trafficking.\nThe\nNew York Times\nexposed\na secret Emirati drone base at the Amdjarass airport, near the Sudanese border, that supported the RSF. The investigation uncovered long-range Chinese-made Wing Loong drones that were launched from an upgraded airstrip disguised as a humanitarian project tied to an Emirati-run Red Crescent hospital. Drone-equipped militias had\nhigher civilian fatality rates\nin urban confrontations.\nThe UAE’s financial and diplomatic heft compounds the challenge. Its oil and trade-based soft power and $569 billion GDP make it far more powerful than Sudan’s $30 billion economy, and its close ties with Western governments make matters worse.\nU.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen and Rep. Sara Jacobs, who\nattempted to block\na $1.2 billion arms deal with the UAE last year,\nconfirmed\nin January that the UAE reneged on pledges to halt support to the RSF, per Biden administration briefings—a breach that has enabled the RSF to kill thousands.\nAmid a weakened international justice system, exemplified by recent\nU.S. sanctions\non the International Criminal Court, this case will test whether global courts will hold powerful states accountable or succumb to political and procedural pressures.\nIn December 2023, South Africa\ninitiated\nlegal action against Israel at the ICJ, charging it with genocide in Gaza. Several countries from the global south have enthusiastically supported South Africa’s case, including Algeria, Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Pakistan. This marked a pivotal moment of global south solidarity. South Africa’s case against Israel leveraged its moral legacy of anti-apartheid activism and anti-colonialism.\nSudan’s recent history lacks such advantages, but its current crisis lays bare the grave challenges of many postcolonial states, including exploitation by internal and external forces. The current conflict—marked by massive civilian suffering, displacement, targeted violence, and the collapse of state institutions—stands as one of the gravest humanitarian and political crises of our time. However, it is not simply a\ndomestic conflict\n; rather, it is a manifestation of international neglect, regional manipulation, and the continued marginalization of Africa.\nIf the countries that backed South Africa fail to lend similar support to Sudan, it would undermine the integrity of the principles upon which global south solidarity is built. It would risk reinforcing the very asymmetries of the application of international law, where justice is selectively weaponized by great powers while systematically denied to the vulnerable.\nSupporting the case against the UAE should not be conflated with backing the Sudanese government in its conflict with the RSF. The record of the SAF is not unblemished. The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED)\nfound\nthat the SAF were responsible for approximately 200 incidents involving civilian casualties in 2024, compared to around 1,300 events attributed to the RSF.\nWhile SAF casualties are often framed as collateral damage in counterinsurgency operations, this does not absolve the army of responsibility for harm or their duty to minimize it. Moreover, the Sudanese government’s bureaucratic obstacles to humanitarian aid have exacerbated what is now regarded as the\nworst humanitarian disaster\nin modern history.\nInstead, support for Sudan’s case should be grounded in principle. The UAE’s extensive patronage networks, underpinned by its oil wealth and influence, as well as its strategic alignments with both Western and non-Western powers, make its alleged violations even more consequential: An unchecked UAE, emboldened by impunity, will continue to manipulate regional conflicts—from Sudan, to Libya, to Yemen, to Syria—undermining many sovereign states in the global south in its quest for resources and influence.\nThe stakes are extremely high\nfor the international justice system. A successful ruling could reinvigorate the ICJ’s credibility, but that will require widespread support in the same spirit that animated support for South Africa’s case against Israel.\nThe UAE will no doubt hide behind its reservation to Article IX of the Genocide Convention, which establishes the ICJ’s jurisdiction over the convention’s implementation. However,\nlegal scholars\nhave\nchallenged\nthe validity of reservations to Article IX because they contradict the spirit of the convention and\nshield\nstates from accountability. The ICJ itself issued an\nadvisory opinion\nin 1951, stating that reservations to treaties such as the Genocide Convention could only be accepted if they did not conflict with the object and purpose of the treaty, which aims to prevent and punish genocide.\nBy failing to decisively back Sudan, the nations of the global south will leave a power vacuum, inviting exploitation by stronger actors for military basing, resource extraction, or geopolitical leverage.\nIndeed, if they ignore Sudan’s grievances, their silence will cement a paradigm in which wealth and power trump accountability, leaving Sudanese victims as collateral damage in a geopolitical game.\nAmgad Fareid Eltayeb\nis a former assistant chief of staff to Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, serving in that role from January 2020 to February 2021.\nRead More On\nGenocide & Crimes Against Humanity\n|\nInternational Organizations\n|\nLaw\n|\nMigration and Immigration\n|\nSudan\n|\nUnited Arab Emirates\nJoin the Conversation\nCommenting on this and other recent articles is just one benefit of a\nForeign Policy\nsubscription.\nAlready a subscriber?\nLog In\n.\nSubscribe\nSubscribe\nView\nComments\nJoin the Conversation\nJoin the conversation on this and other recent\nForeign Policy\narticles when you subscribe now.\nSubscribe\nSubscribe\nNot your account?\nLog out\nView\nComments\nJoin the Conversation\nPlease follow our\ncomment guidelines\n, stay on topic, and be civil, courteous, and respectful of others’ beliefs.\nYou are commenting as\n.\nChange your username\n|\nLog out\nChange your username:\nUsername\nI agree to abide by FP’s\ncomment guidelines\n.

Chris Van Hollen and Rep.

Several countries from the global south have enthusiastically supported South Africa’s case, including Algeria, Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Pakistan. This marked a pivotal moment of global south solidarity. South Africa’s case against Israel leveraged its moral legacy of anti-apartheid activism and anti-colonialism.\nSudan’s recent history lacks such advantages, but its current crisis lays bare the grave challenges of many postcolonial states, including exploitation by internal and external forces. The current conflict—marked by massive civilian suffering, displacement, targeted violence, and the collapse of state institutions—stands as one of the gravest humanitarian and political crises of our time. However, it is not simply a\ndomestic conflict\n; rather, it is a manifestation of international neglect, regional manipulation, and the continued marginalization of Africa.\nIf the countries that backed South Africa fail to lend similar support to Sudan, it would undermine the integrity of the principles upon which global south solidarity is built. It would risk reinforcing the very asymmetries of the application of international law, where justice is selectively weaponized by great powers while systematically denied to the vulnerable.\nSupporting the case against the UAE should not be conflated with backing the Sudanese government in its conflict with the RSF. The record of the SAF is not unblemished. The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED)\nfound\nthat the SAF were responsible for approximately 200 incidents involving civilian casualties in 2024, compared to around 1,300 events attributed to the RSF.\nWhile SAF casualties are often framed as collateral damage in counterinsurgency operations, this does not absolve the army of responsibility for harm or their duty to minimize it. Moreover, the Sudanese government’s bureaucratic obstacles to humanitarian aid have exacerbated what is now regarded as the\nworst humanitarian disaster\nin modern history.\nInstead, support for Sudan’s case should be grounded in principle. The UAE’s extensive patronage networks, underpinned by its oil wealth and influence, as well as its strategic alignments with both Western and non-Western powers, make its alleged violations even more consequential: An unchecked UAE, emboldened by impunity, will continue to manipulate regional conflicts—from Sudan, to Libya, to Yemen, to Syria—undermining many sovereign states in the global south in its quest for resources and influence.\nThe stakes are extremely high\nfor the international justice system. A successful ruling could reinvigorate the ICJ’s credibility, but that will require widespread support in the same spirit that animated support for South Africa’s case against Israel.\nThe UAE will no doubt hide behind its reservation to Article IX of the Genocide Convention, which establishes the ICJ’s jurisdiction over the convention’s implementation. However,\nlegal scholars\nhave\nchallenged\nthe validity of reservations to Article IX because they contradict the spirit of the convention and\nshield\nstates from accountability. The ICJ itself issued an\nadvisory opinion\nin 1951, stating that reservations to treaties such as the Genocide Convention could only be accepted if they did not conflict with the object and purpose of the treaty, which aims to prevent and punish genocide.\nBy failing to decisively back Sudan, the nations of the global south will leave a power vacuum, inviting exploitation by stronger actors for military basing, resource extraction, or geopolitical leverage.\nIndeed, if they ignore Sudan’s grievances, their silence will cement a paradigm in which wealth and power trump accountability, leaving Sudanese victims as collateral damage in a geopolitical game.\nAmgad Fareid Eltayeb\nis a former assistant chief of staff to Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, serving in that role from January 2020 to February 2021.\nRead More On\nGenocide & Crimes Against Humanity\n|\nInternational Organizations\n|\nLaw\n|\nMigration and Immigration\n|\nSudan\n|\nUnited Arab Emirates\nJoin the Conversation\nCommenting on this and other recent articles is just one benefit of a\nForeign Policy\nsubscription.\nAlready a subscriber?\nLog In\n.\nSubscribe\nSubscribe\nView\nComments\nJoin the Conversation\nJoin the conversation on this and other recent\nForeign Policy\narticles when you subscribe now.\nSubscribe\nSubscribe\nNot your account?\nLog out\nView\nComments\nJoin the Conversation\nPlease follow our\ncomment guidelines\n, stay on topic, and be civil, courteous, and respectful of others’ beliefs.\nYou are commenting as\n.\nChange your username\n|\nLog out\nChange your username:\nUsername\nI agree to abide by FP’s\ncomment guidelines\n.

    "cleaned_text_content": "# ICJ Genocide Case: Sudan Accuses UAE of Backing RSF Killings\n\n## Argument: The Global South Must Back Sudan’s ICJ Case Against the UAE\n\n*Dozens of countries supported South Africa’s genocide charges against Israel. Failure to do the same for Sudan would be a moral and diplomatic disaster.*\n\nBy Amgad Fareid Eltayeb, a former assistant chief of staff to Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok.\n\nA woman carries a bunch of dried reeds while walking through the Tiamushro camp for internally displaced people in Kadugli, Sudan, on June 18, 2024.\n\n(Guy Peterson/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nMarch 17, 2025, 2:33 PM\n\n\nOn March 6, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) announced that Sudan had filed proceedings against the United Arab Emirates, accusing it of complicity in genocide. Sudan alleges the UAE’s sustained support for the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group that has waged a brutal power struggle against the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) since April 2023, amounts to abetting a war crime.\n\nThe case also cites the RSF’s documented atrocities against the Masalit group. Between May and June 2023, up to 15,000 Masalit civilians in West Darfur were massacred and at least 500,000 were displaced into Chad—echoing the early 2000s Darfur conflict, when the Janjaweed militias, RSF’s predecessors, committed similar crimes for President Omar al-Bashir’s Islamist regime.\n\nSudan accuses the UAE of breaching the Genocide Convention by enabling the RSF’s genocidal acts. Forensic evidence, including a report from the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights and a separate Human Rights Watch report, has detailed the RSF’s systematic killings, sexual violence, and incineration of whole villages in West Darfur. Satellite imagery analyzed by Yale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab exposes the widespread destruction of civilian settlements.  The United Nations’ report on the discovery of mass graves following RSF attacks further reinforces the evidence. Survivor accounts describe RSF fighters targeting the Masalit for their ethnicity, chanting racial slurs while executing civilians, including children, which demonstrates clear evidence of genocidal intent. The U.S. State Department’s January designation of RSF actions as genocide, though tardy under the Biden administration, aligns with these findings.\n\nThe UAE’s role is not conjecture but a matter of meticulously documented fact. In January 2024, the U.N. Security Council’s Panel of Experts reported credible evidence of UAE involvement and weapons supply to the RSF via its Amdjarass base in Chad. Flight tracking data and satellite images analyzed by the Conflict Observatory, a U.S. nongovernmental organization that verifies reports of war crimes in Sudan and Ukraine, concluded with “near certainty” that the UAE transferred weapons to the RSF. Reuters reported that there were at least 86 flights from the UAE to Amdjarass since the war began, with three-quarters operated by carriers previously linked to arms trafficking. The New York Times exposed a secret Emirati drone base at the Amdjarass airport, near the Sudanese border, that supported the RSF. The investigation uncovered long-range Chinese-made Wing Loong drones that were launched from an upgraded airstrip disguised as a humanitarian project tied to an Emirati-run Red Crescent hospital. Drone-equipped militias had higher civilian fatality rates in urban confrontations.\n\nThe UAE’s financial and diplomatic heft compounds the challenge. Its oil and trade-based soft power and $569 billion GDP make it far more powerful than Sudan’s $30 billion economy, and its close ties with Western governments make matters worse. U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen and Rep. Sara Jacobs, who attempted to block a $1.2 billion arms deal with the UAE last year, confirmed in January that the UAE reneged on pledges to halt support to the RSF, per Biden administration briefings—a breach that has enabled the RSF to kill thousands.\n\nAmid a weakened international justice system, exemplified by recent U.S. sanctions on the International Criminal Court, this case will test whether global courts will hold powerful states accountable or succumb to political and procedural pressures.\n\nIn December 2023, South Africa initiated legal action against Israel at the ICJ, charging it with genocide in Gaza. Several countries from the global south have enthusiastically supported South Africa’s case, including Algeria, Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Pakistan. This marked a pivotal moment of global south solidarity. South Africa’s case against Israel leveraged its moral legacy of anti-apartheid activism and anti-colonialism.\n\nSudan’s recent history lacks such advantages, but its current crisis lays bare the grave challenges of many postcolonial states, including exploitation by internal and external forces. The current conflict—marked by massive civilian suffering, displacement, targeted violence, and the collapse of state institutions—stands as one of the gravest humanitarian and political crises of our time. However, it is not simply a domestic conflict; rather, it is a manifestation of international neglect, regional manipulation, and the continued marginalization of Africa.\n\nIf the countries that backed South Africa fail to lend similar support to Sudan, it would undermine the integrity of the principles upon which global south solidarity is built. It would risk reinforcing the very asymmetries of the application of international law, where justice is selectively weaponized by great powers while systematically denied to the vulnerable.\n\nSupporting the case against the UAE should not be conflated with backing the Sudanese government in its conflict with the RSF. The record of the SAF is not unblemished.

UAE support for Daglo, though denied by the Emiratis, serves \"to challenge Saudi objectives\", Donelli said.\n\nThe relationship is also ideological, with the RSF willing to contain the Muslim Brotherhood political movement, which is outlawed by the UAE and other Arab states, Krieg said.\n\nThis sets the RSF apart from the army, which has been linked with remnants of the Islamist regime of former dictator Omar al-Bashir.\n\nBoth sides have faced claims of war crimes during Sudan's bitter conflict, which has killed tens of thousands of people and uprooted more than 12 million.\n\nBut in January, Washington accused the RSF of genocide for targeting ethnic groups with mass killings and gang rapes.\n\nAlso in January, two US lawmakers said the UAE had broken its promises to stop providing military aid to the RSF.\n\nDaglo's private finances are run from the UAE, Krieg said, adding that he had become \"co-dependent\" on Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe RSF has received crucial support from the UAE, including arms deliveries through neighbouring Chad, diplomats, analysts and human rights groups say.\n\nThe UAE denies the allegations.\n\nWill the case affect the UAE?\n\nSudan filed its case against the UAE at the ICJ, the top UN court in The Hague, on Thursday, claiming complicity in genocide over Abu Dhabi's alleged support for the RSF.\n\nThe UAE dismissed the case as a \"publicity stunt\" and said it would try to have it thrown out.\n\nICJ rulings are legally binding, but the court has no power to enforce them.\n\nDonelli said the case was likely to cause reputational damage to the UAE.\n\n\"Both internationally and within Africa, there is an increasing perception of the Emirates as a destabilising actor,\" he told AFP.\n\nBut \"the financial and political prominence that the UAE has gained over the past decade will likely shield it from any serious repercussions\".\n",

    "text_content": "The Hague (AFP) – Sudan has filed a case against the United Arab Emirates at the International Court of Justice, arguing the UAE is complicit in genocide over its alleged support for Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.\n\nIssued on: 07/03/2025 - 10:23\n\nKhartoum contends the UAE is \"complicit in the genocide on the Masalit (community in Sudan) through its direction of and provision of extensive financial, political, and military support for the rebel RSF militia,\" the ICJ said in a statement.\n\n\"The United Arab Emirates fuels the rebellion and supports the militia that has committed the crime of genocide in West Darfur,\" the Sudan submission to the court said.\n\nThe UAE, which has repeatedly denied supporting the RSF, dismissed the case as a \"publicity stunt\" and said it would try to have it thrown out.\n\nThe case \"is nothing more than a cynical publicity stunt aimed at diverting attention,\" a UAE official said in a statement sent to AFP, adding: \"The UAE will seek the immediate dismissal of this baseless application.\"\n\nProtracted war\n\nFor nearly two years, the RSF and the regular army in Sudan have fought a war that has killed tens of thousands of people and uprooted more than 12 million. Famine has been declared in parts of the country and is likely to spread.\n\nSudan called on the ICJ, which rules in disputes between countries, to issue emergency orders – \"provisional measures\" in the court jargon – to force the UAE to pay reparations, among other requests.\n\n\"The United Arab Emirates must make full reparation for the injury caused (by) its internationally wrongful acts, including paying reimbursement to the victims of the war,\" Sudan's submission argued.\n\nICJ rulings are legally binding but the court has no power to enforce them.\n\nFor example, it ordered Russia to halt its assault on Ukraine only a few weeks after the invasion – to no avail.\n\nBut Khartoum urged the court to act quickly \"to ensure the urgent and fullest possible protection for the Sudanese civilian people who remain at grave and immediate risk of continuing and further acts of genocide\".\n\nSudan's submission accused the RSF of \"genocide, murder, theft of property, rape, forcible displacement, trespassing, vandalism of public properties, and violations of human rights\".\n\nIt added that these acts were \"perpetrated and enabled by the direct support given to the rebel RSF militia and related militia groups by the United Arab Emirates\".\n\nSudan charged that the UAE was breaching its obligations under the 1948 UN Genocide Convention \"by attempting to commit genocide, conspiring to commit genocide, inciting genocide, complicity in genocide, and failing to prevent and punish genocide\".\n\nUAE denials\n\nThe UAE official said: \"The allegations presented by the SAF representative at the ICJ lack any legal or factual basis, representing yet another attempt to distract from this calamitous war.\"\n\nIn June, Sudan's UN ambassador Al-Harith Idriss al-Harith accused the UAE of fomenting conflict in his country, saying the RSF was being \"supported with weapons by the Emirates\".\n\nThe Emirati envoy to the United Nations, Mohamed Issa Hamad Mohamed Abushahab, rejected the claims as \"ludicrous\" and accused Sudan of using the council to plead the army's case.\n\nUN experts monitoring an arms embargo on Darfur said accusations that the UAE had funnelled weapons to the RSF through Chad were \"credible\".\n\nThe Gulf state promised the United States in December that it would not arm the RSF, after two US lawmakers attempted to block its purchase of $1.2 billion in advanced rockets and long-range missiles.\n\nIn January, the US lawmakers said the UAE had broken its promises and was still supplying the Sudanese rebels.",

The UAE called the filing a publicity stunt and said it would seek to have the case dismissed.\nThe International Court of Justice said Sudan’s case, filed Wednesday, concerns acts allegedly perpetrated by the Rapid Support Forces and allied militias including “genocide, murder, theft of property, rape, forcible displacement, trespassing, vandalism of public properties, and violation of human rights” targeting the Masalit people.\nThe United Arab Emirates issued a statement after the filing asserting the case was a “nothing more than a cynical publicity stunt.”\nThe filing is “aimed at diverting attention from the established complicity of the Sudanese Armed Forces in the widespread atrocities that continue to devastate Sudan and its people,” the UAE statement said, referring to the government-backed forces fighting in the war.\nRELATED COVERAGE\nSudanese police accuse RSF paramilitaries after 11 bodies found at bottom of a well in Khartoum\nAP Exclusive: US and Israel look to Africa for moving Palestinians uprooted from Gaza\nUN: Sudan war is world’s worst humanitarian crisis: 30 million need aid, 16 million of them kids\nBoth the RSF and the Sudanese military have been accused of abuses in the war.\nThe UAE statement said the allegations in Sudan’s case “lack any legal or factual basis, representing yet another attempt to distract from this calamitous war. Out of respect for the International Court of Justice, as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, the UAE will seek the immediate dismissal of this baseless application.”\nSudan alleges that the UAE was “complicit in the genocide on the Masalit through its direction of and provision of extensive financial, political, and military support for the rebel RSF militia,” the court said.\nSudan also asked the court to impose urgent interim orders known as provisional measures on the UAE, including doing all it can to prevent the killing and other crimes targeting the Masalit.\nBoth Sudan and the UAE are signatories to the 1948 genocide convention.\nSudan descended into a deadly\nconflict\nin mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary rebels broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions.\nThe war has killed more than 24,000 people and driven over 14 million people — about 30% of the population — from their homes, according to the United Nations. An estimated 3.2 million Sudanese have escaped to neighboring countries.\nThe case at the world court was announced less than two weeks after the Rapid Support Forces and its allies signed a charter that paved the way for the establishment of a parallel government, following recent advances by Sudan’s army against the rival groups.\nThe group Conflict Observatory, which is funded by the U.S. State Department and has been monitoring the war in Sudan, has identified aircraft it says carried UAE arms transfers to the RSF. Those flights went through Aéroport International Maréchal Idriss Deby in Amdjarass, Chad — flights the UAE has claimed have been for supporting a local hospital.\nIn January, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that RSF leader Mohammad Hamdan Daglo Mousa, also known as Hemedti, had been targeted for sanctions along with seven RSF-owned companies in the United Arab Emirates, including one handling gold likely smuggled out of Sudan. That came as the U.S. declared the RSF are committing genocide.\nThe UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula and a U.S. ally, has been repeatedly accused of arming the RSF, something it\nhas strenuously denied\ndespite evidence to the contrary.\nThe UAE said it has been calling for an immediate ceasefire in the war.\n“The Sudanese Armed Forces’ application to the ICJ does not absolve it from its legal and moral responsibility for its criminal acts and the catastrophic humanitarian crisis in the country,” the UAE said.\nTwo decades ago, the Sudanese region of Darfur became synonymous with genocide and war crimes, particularly by the notorious Janjaweed Arab militias, against populations that identify as Central or East African. Up to 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million were driven from their homes.\nRulings by the International Court of Justice, also known as the world court, take years to reach and are legally binding.\n____\nAssociated Press writer Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed.\nMost read\nNew Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney seeks alliances in Europe as he deals with Trump\nNASA’s stuck astronauts welcome their newly arrived replacements to the space station\nTrump invokes 18th century law to speed deportations, judge stalls it hours later\nTrump orders strikes on Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen and issues new warning\nWhat to know about El Salvador’s mega-prison after Trump sent hundreds of immigrants there\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

Research from US universities, however, estimates the death toll at around 130,000.\nInternational and UN calls for an end to the war are mounting, warning of an impending humanitarian catastrophe as millions face famine and death due to food shortages. The conflict has spread to 13 of Sudan’s 18 states.\nAnadolu Agency website contains only a portion of the news stories offered to subscribers in the AA News Broadcasting System (HAS), and in summarized form.\nPlease contact us for subscription options.\nRelated topics\nICJ\nInternational Court of Justice\nRapid Support Forces\nRSF\nSudan\nUAE\nUnited Arab Emirates\nUnited Nations Security Council\nBu haberi paylaşın\nWorld\nPutin has been unable to ‘force out a simple yes’ to a US ceasefire proposal for a week: Zelenskyy\nZelenskyy tasks military leadership to engage in efforts to identify Ukraine’s defense needs\nUS to exit international coalition investigating Russia's alleged war crimes in Ukraine\nTelegram CEO Durov back in Dubai as French probe continues\nFasting in the Arctic: A Palestinian’s unique Ramadan in Greenland\nRelated news\nUN warns of 'growing' food shortages in Sudan's Zamzam refugee camp amid intensified clashes\nSudanese army seizes strategic locations in central Khartoum amid fighting with rebel faction\nEgypt says Sudan's division is a ‘red line’\nUAE, Bahrain launch satellites to boost space, climate monitoring\nSudan halts all imports from Kenya over its support for Rapid Support Forces\nChildren in Sudan endure widespread sexual violence, UNICEF chief warns\nCorporate\nHistory\nEditorial Guidelines\nSocial Media Policies\nExecutive Team\nDomestic Offices\nInternational Offices\nMedia Center\nCommunication\nRSS\nSubscription Requests\nAnnouncement Service\nQuality Management\nPrivacy and Cookies Policy\nInformation Policy\nDiary\nNetwork\nBusiness News\nFinance Terminal\nAnadolu Images\nEnergy Terminal\nAA Academy\nGreen Line\nDiscrimination Line\nFact Check Line\nDeğişen Dünyanın Habercisi\nIPhone Application\nIPad Application\nAndroid Application\nAnadolu Ajansı © 2021\nWe use cookies in a limited and restricted manner for specific purposes.

This follows the lead of\nSouth Africa\nwhich has won some diplomatic and legal kudos from launching a case at the ICJ against\nIsrael\nfor genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.\nBeyond putting spotlight on the UAE monarchy’s sponsorship and arming of the RSF since the start of the war in April 2023, the SAF’s case at the ICJ will also tie in President\nMahamat Idriss Déby Itno\n’s government which has facilitated the delivery of arms from the UAE to the RSF from an airstrip at Amdjarass in eastern\nChad\n(AC Vol 66 No 5,\nHemeti struggles to launch in Nairobi, again\n). A UN experts’ report last year cited ‘credible reports’ documenting the arms deliveries; some included footage showing pallets on the tarmac at Amdjarass with khaki crates bearing UAE flags. It could put the spotlight on other countries – such as\nUganda\nand\nLibya\n– accused of helping to deliver UAE arms to the RSF.\nGen Burhan is using the legal status of the SAF regime in Port Sudan as the internationally recognised government to launch the case against UAE at the ICJ.

Sudan has requested that, pending final judgment, the ICJ indicate provisional measures.\nBoth the application itself, and the request for provisional measures, provide the most recent example of States invoking the Genocide Convention and requiring the World Court to adjudicate on active conflicts across the globe.\nThree Conflicts in Recent Years\nThe conflict in Sudan is the third in recent years to give rise to a dispute before the ICJ which relies on the Genocide Convention dispute.\nFirst, in\nAllegations of Genocide Under the Convention on Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Ukraine v. Russian Federation)\n,\nUkraine asserted that the basis upon which Russia justified its 2022 invasion gave rise to a dispute under the Convention.\nOn\n16 March 2022 the ICJ made an order\nto indicate provisional measures, including (by 13 votes to 2), to require the Russian Federation to “\nimmediately suspend the military operations that it commenced on 24 February 2022 in the territory of Ukraine\n”.\nThe order also, by unanimity, required both Ukraine and the Russian Federation, to “\nrefrain from any action which might aggravate or extend the dispute before the Court or make it more difficult to resolve\n”. The proceedings remain ongoing, and as of early 2025 the Court is seized with the question as to\nwhether or not certain counter-claims made by the Russian Federation are admissible\n.\nSecond, in\nApplication of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in the Gaza Strip (South Africa v. Israel)\n, the Court initially indicated interim measures on 26 January 2024. In a carefully reasoned Order, it concluded that it has\nprima facie\njurisdiction (jurisdiction “on the face of it”) over the dispute, and that South Africa has\nprima facie\nstanding to bring the claim.\nIn one of the more misunderstood aspects of the analysis, the Court also concluded that at least some of the rights asserted by South Africa are plausible (i.e. the right of Palestinians in Gaza to be protected from acts of genocide and related prohibited acts), and that there was a link between those plausible rights and the provisional measures sought. As a result the ICJ indicated certain measures which, in effect, require Israel to comply with the Genocide Convention.\nOn 28 March 2024, after a renewed application from South Africa, the Court once again indicated provisional measures, this time aimed at the prevention of famine and starvation, as well as access to basic services, humanitarian assistance, and medical care.\nThen, on 24 May 2024, after a further application,\nthe Court ordered Israel\nto “\nimmediately half its military offensive, and any other action in the Rafah Governorate, which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part\n”. The proceedings are ongoing.\nAlleged Breaches of Certain International Obligations in respect of the Occupied Palestinian Territory (Nicaragua v. Germany)\nalso relates to the conflict in Gaza. In contrast with South Africa’s case, however, Nicaragua’s application relates not to Israel, but to Germany, on the basis of the latter’s support for Israel. And, in contrast with both the Ukrainian and South African applications, Nicaragua was not successful in its request for the indication of provisional measures.\nThe analysis in the Court’s order of 30 April 2024, refusing the request, is notable for its brevity in contrast with the orders in\nSouth Africa v. Israel\n. It is less methodical and largely consists of an account of the facts as alleged by both Parties. Despite the short shrift given to the request (described elsewhere as a “\npragmatic\n” approach) the Court also refused Germany’s request to delist the case entirely. As a result proceedings, too, are ongoing.\nSudan’s Application to the Court\nSudan has now added another conflict to the first two – its struggle against the RSF in West Sudan. Sudan’s application, entitled\nProceedings Instituted by Sudan against the United Arab Emirates\n, relates to the activities of the RSF, and the UAE’s alleged support for the organisation and related militias. The conflict in Sudan, and the impact on the Masalit people in particular, has already attracted\nattention at the United Nations\n.\nSudan claims that the UAE has violated its obligations under Article I of the Genocide Convention (an obligation to prevent and to punish genocide). It alleges that the UAE is “\ncomplicit in the genocide on the Masalit\n” by direction of and provision of “\nextensive financial, political, and military support\n” for the RSF.\nAs with the three cases already before the Court, in relation to Ukraine and Gaza, the ultimate resolution of Sudan’s application will take years. In the interim, however, the request for provisional measures will, once against, bring the Genocide Convention before the Court.\nRequest for Provisional Measures\nIn addition to the final relief, Sudan has also requested, pursuant to Article 41 of the\nICJ Statute\nthe indication of provisional measures. This approach follows a recent trend – both in the cases brought pursuant to the Genocide Convention (set out above) as well as more generally – whereby applications to the Court have been accompanied with robust, even ambitious, requests for provisional measures.\nIn Sudan’s case, the\nrequest\nis for the Court to order the UAE to take “\nall measures within its power\n” to prevent the commission of acts contrary to Article II of the Genocide Conventions, as well as to order the UAE to ensure that any “\nirregular armed units\n” which it directs or supports (and related persons and organisations) do not commit any acts contrary to Article II, or any related acts.\nIn some respects, a request for the indication of provisional measures may be more impactful than the ultimate determination of the case. The threshold for the indication of provisional measures is necessarily lower than that which applies when the case comes for final determination before the Court.\nMoreover, provisional measures raise the prospect of the Court having an immediate impact on an ongoing situation, rather than an after the fact determination of the lawfulness of things already done.\nAs former ICJ President, Judge Joan Donoghue,\nhas said\n, once the Court delivers a final judgment, it is not a “monitoring mechanism”. In contrast, in\nSouth Africa v. Israel\n, the Court has required Israel to report on its compliance with provisional measures, and Israel has done so.\nIn Sudan’s case, it will be of interest to see which of the two approaches relied upon more recently prevails: the more methodical approach of\nSouth Africa v. Israel\n, or the more cursory – “pragmatic” – approach in\nNicaragua v. Germany\n. And, if the Court does indicate provisional measures, the actual impact of those measures on the ground will give a further indication of the Court’s influence.\nLaw’s Potency and Limitations\nSudan’s application, then, is a reminder of the potency of, and limitations of, both procedural and substantive law in the face of conflicts which have devastating daily impacts on the lives of millions.\nIn terms of procedure, part of the potency of a request for the indication of provisional measures is that, in accordance with Article 74 of the Rules of the Court, such a request “\nshall have priority over all other cases\n”. The procedure therefore offers States an opportunity to achieve a timely intervention in an ongoing situation. After careful consideration in South Africa’s case, the reasoning in Nicaragua’s was more conclusory, and it remains to be seen if this marks a sea-change or not.\nIn terms of substantive law, it is notable that Ukraine, South Africa, Nicaragua, and Sudan, have all relied on the Genocide Convention. The Convention is a potent tool, both because of the moral force of a claim that acts of genocide are being carried out, and – relatedly – because of the legal force which those claims have had, in particular since the decision in\nApplication of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (The Gambia v. Myanmar\n)\n.\nHowever, not all disputes are capable of characterisation as falling within the nexus of the Genocide Convention. In the future, a\ntreaty on crimes against humanity\nmay provide a jurisdictional basis to bring a conflict before the Court, resort to the morally, legally, and politically difficult concept of genocide. (See also on this\nthe comments of Judge Donoghue\n). That treaty, though, remains some way off.\nIn the interim, however slow the wheels may turn, the Genocide Convention is likely to remain grist to the mill of international justice. No adjudicative body, or indeed international organisation of any kind, has proven capable of preventing all conflict. Still, in the face of diplomatic malaise, the ICJ’s authority as an independent judicial organ makes it an ever more valuable forum for a rules-based international order.\nTags\ninternational law\n,\nhuman rights\nGet in touch\nCian Murphy\nBarrister\nGet in touch\nCian Murphy\nBarrister\nLatest Insights\n3/10/2025 11:51:40 AM\nHow does an assured shorthold tenancy become a secure tenancy?

Sudan has requested that, pending final judgment, the ICJ indicate provisional measures.\nBoth the application itself, and the request for provisional measures, provide the most recent example of States invoking the Genocide Convention and requiring the World Court to adjudicate on active conflicts across the globe.\nThree Conflicts in Recent Years\nThe conflict in Sudan is the third in recent years to give rise to a dispute before the ICJ which relies on the Genocide Convention dispute.\nFirst, in\nAllegations of Genocide Under the Convention on Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Ukraine v. Russian Federation)\n,\nUkraine asserted that the basis upon which Russia justified its 2022 invasion gave rise to a dispute under the Convention.\nOn\n16 March 2022 the ICJ made an order\nto indicate provisional measures, including (by 13 votes to 2), to require the Russian Federation to “\nimmediately suspend the military operations that it commenced on 24 February 2022 in the territory of Ukraine\n”.\nThe order also, by unanimity, required both Ukraine and the Russian Federation, to “\nrefrain from any action which might aggravate or extend the dispute before the Court or make it more difficult to resolve\n”. The proceedings remain ongoing, and as of early 2025 the Court is seized with the question as to\nwhether or not certain counter-claims made by the Russian Federation are admissible\n.\nSecond, in\nApplication of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in the Gaza Strip (South Africa v. Israel)\n, the Court initially indicated interim measures on 26 January 2024. In a carefully reasoned Order, it concluded that it has\nprima facie\njurisdiction (jurisdiction “on the face of it”) over the dispute, and that South Africa has\nprima facie\nstanding to bring the claim.\nIn one of the more misunderstood aspects of the analysis, the Court also concluded that at least some of the rights asserted by South Africa are plausible (i.e. the right of Palestinians in Gaza to be protected from acts of genocide and related prohibited acts), and that there was a link between those plausible rights and the provisional measures sought. As a result the ICJ indicated certain measures which, in effect, require Israel to comply with the Genocide Convention.\nOn 28 March 2024, after a renewed application from South Africa, the Court once again indicated provisional measures, this time aimed at the prevention of famine and starvation, as well as access to basic services, humanitarian assistance, and medical care.\nThen, on 24 May 2024, after a further application,\nthe Court ordered Israel\nto “\nimmediately half its military offensive, and any other action in the Rafah Governorate, which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part\n”. The proceedings are ongoing.\nAlleged Breaches of Certain International Obligations in respect of the Occupied Palestinian Territory (Nicaragua v. Germany)\nalso relates to the conflict in Gaza. In contrast with South Africa’s case, however, Nicaragua’s application relates not to Israel, but to Germany, on the basis of the latter’s support for Israel. And, in contrast with both the Ukrainian and South African applications, Nicaragua was not successful in its request for the indication of provisional measures.\nThe analysis in the Court’s order of 30 April 2024, refusing the request, is notable for its brevity in contrast with the orders in\nSouth Africa v. Israel\n. It is less methodical and largely consists of an account of the facts as alleged by both Parties. Despite the short shrift given to the request (described elsewhere as a “\npragmatic\n” approach) the Court also refused Germany’s request to delist the case entirely. As a result proceedings, too, are ongoing.\nSudan’s Application to the Court\nSudan has now added another conflict to the first two – its struggle against the RSF in West Sudan. Sudan’s application, entitled\nProceedings Instituted by Sudan against the United Arab Emirates\n, relates to the activities of the RSF, and the UAE’s alleged support for the organisation and related militias. The conflict in Sudan, and the impact on the Masalit people in particular, has already attracted\nattention at the United Nations\n.\nSudan claims that the UAE has violated its obligations under Article I of the Genocide Convention (an obligation to prevent and to punish genocide). It alleges that the UAE is “\ncomplicit in the genocide on the Masalit\n” by direction of and provision of “\nextensive financial, political, and military support\n” for the RSF.\nAs with the three cases already before the Court, in relation to Ukraine and Gaza, the ultimate resolution of Sudan’s application will take years. In the interim, however, the request for provisional measures will, once against, bring the Genocide Convention before the Court.\nRequest for Provisional Measures\nIn addition to the final relief, Sudan has also requested, pursuant to Article 41 of the\nICJ Statute\nthe indication of provisional measures. This approach follows a recent trend – both in the cases brought pursuant to the Genocide Convention (set out above) as well as more generally – whereby applications to the Court have been accompanied with robust, even ambitious, requests for provisional measures.\nIn Sudan’s case, the\nrequest\nis for the Court to order the UAE to take “\nall measures within its power\n” to prevent the commission of acts contrary to Article II of the Genocide Conventions, as well as to order the UAE to ensure that any “\nirregular armed units\n” which it directs or supports (and related persons and organisations) do not commit any acts contrary to Article II, or any related acts.\nIn some respects, a request for the indication of provisional measures may be more impactful than the ultimate determination of the case. The threshold for the indication of provisional measures is necessarily lower than that which applies when the case comes for final determination before the Court.\nMoreover, provisional measures raise the prospect of the Court having an immediate impact on an ongoing situation, rather than an after the fact determination of the lawfulness of things already done.\nAs former ICJ President, Judge Joan Donoghue,\nhas said\n, once the Court delivers a final judgment, it is not a “monitoring mechanism”. In contrast, in\nSouth Africa v. Israel\n, the Court has required Israel to report on its compliance with provisional measures, and Israel has done so.\nIn Sudan’s case, it will be of interest to see which of the two approaches relied upon more recently prevails: the more methodical approach of\nSouth Africa v. Israel\n, or the more cursory – “pragmatic” – approach in\nNicaragua v. Germany\n. And, if the Court does indicate provisional measures, the actual impact of those measures on the ground will give a further indication of the Court’s influence.\nLaw’s Potency and Limitations\nSudan’s application, then, is a reminder of the potency of, and limitations of, both procedural and substantive law in the face of conflicts which have devastating daily impacts on the lives of millions.\nIn terms of procedure, part of the potency of a request for the indication of provisional measures is that, in accordance with Article 74 of the Rules of the Court, such a request “\nshall have priority over all other cases\n”. The procedure therefore offers States an opportunity to achieve a timely intervention in an ongoing situation. After careful consideration in South Africa’s case, the reasoning in Nicaragua’s was more conclusory, and it remains to be seen if this marks a sea-change or not.\nIn terms of substantive law, it is notable that Ukraine, South Africa, Nicaragua, and Sudan, have all relied on the Genocide Convention. The Convention is a potent tool, both because of the moral force of a claim that acts of genocide are being carried out, and – relatedly – because of the legal force which those claims have had, in particular since the decision in\nApplication of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (The Gambia v. Myanmar\n)\n.\nHowever, not all disputes are capable of characterisation as falling within the nexus of the Genocide Convention. In the future, a\ntreaty on crimes against humanity\nmay provide a jurisdictional basis to bring a conflict before the Court, resort to the morally, legally, and politically difficult concept of genocide. (See also on this\nthe comments of Judge Donoghue\n). That treaty, though, remains some way off.\nIn the interim, however slow the wheels may turn, the Genocide Convention is likely to remain grist to the mill of international justice. No adjudicative body, or indeed international organisation of any kind, has proven capable of preventing all conflict. Still, in the face of diplomatic malaise, the ICJ’s authority as an independent judicial organ makes it an ever more valuable forum for a rules-based international order.\nTags\ninternational law\n,\nhuman rights\nGet in touch\nCian Murphy\nBarrister\nGet in touch\nCian Murphy\nBarrister\nLatest Insights\n3/10/2025 11:51:40 AM\nHow does an assured shorthold tenancy become a secure tenancy?

In a carefully reasoned Order, it concluded that it has *prima facie* jurisdiction (jurisdiction “on the face of it”) over the dispute, and that South Africa has *prima facie* standing to bring the claim.

The conflict has displaced more than 10 million people, and left over 12 million\nfacing high levels of acute food insecurity\n.\nMiddle East Eye has\nreported\non the network of supply lines that exist to funnel arms and other goods from the UAE to the RSF, via allied groups and governments in Libya, Chad and the Central African Republic. The UAE denies providing support to the RSF.\nBoth Sudan and the UAE are parties to the Genocide Convention.\nKhartoum requested that the World Court implements a number of provisional measures, including ordering the UAE to take measures to prevent: the killing and causing serious harm towards the Masalit, deliberately inflicting conditions to bring about the physical destruction of the group, and the imposition of measures that are intended to prevent births within the group.\nIt also called for provisional measures ordering the UAE to ensure that any armed units supported by it do not directly or publicly incite to commit genocide.\nDoubts on jurisdiction\nEmirati Foreign Minister Anwar Gargash commented on the case saying the Sudanese army was pursuing “feeble media maneuvers to justify their rejection of peace and the political path”.\nMeanwhile, a UAE official told Reuters on Thursday that Abu Dhabi would be seeking the immediate dismissal of the case, stating that the allegations \"lack any legal or factual basis\".\nSudan: Genocide 'against non-Arab groups' taking place in Darfur\nRead More »\nThe unnamed official described the application as \"nothing more than a cynical publicity stunt aimed at diverting attention from the established complicity of the Sudanese armed forces in the widespread atrocities that continue to devastate Sudan and its people\".\nAlthough the UAE is a party to the Genocide Convention, on which the case is based, it made a reservtion to Article Nine of the treaty when it acceded to it in 2005, which will likely lead the court to dismiss the case, said Michael Becker, assistant professor of international human rights law at Trinity College Dublin.\nArticle Nine of the convention allows dispute settlement before the ICJ when a state party violates the treaty. States are allowed to opt out of the provision in advance of signing the treaty.\nBy making a reservation to the article, the UAE withheld its consent to this provision, said Becker. Many other states have opted out of this clause, including the US, China, Algeria, Bahrain, Morocco, Malaysia, Yemen and India.\nInternational law allows states to express reservations on treaty provisions, if such reservations do not contradict the object and purpose of the treaty.\n'It strikes me as highly unlikely that Sudan will be able to persuade the ICJ to make a U-turn on this issue'\n- Mike Becker, international law expert\n\"Sudan will likely argue that opting out of ICJ jurisdiction runs contrary to the object and purpose of the Genocide Convention,\" Becker told Middle East Eye. \"This argument is almost certain to fail.\"\nThe ICJ previously ruled in a case between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda in 2006 that reservations to Article Nine do not contradict the object and purpose of the convention.\n\"The court’s rationale turned on the fact that such a reservation does not affect a party’s substantive obligations under the treaty but only excludes one method of settling a dispute relating to those obligations,\" explained Becker.\n\"It strikes me as highly unlikely that Sudan will be able to persuade the ICJ to make a U-turn on this issue, notwithstanding the important legal issues raised by Sudan’s claims against the UAE.\"\nIn response to Becker's online comments to that effect, Sudanese UN envoy Ammar Mahmoud said the above arguments have been \"duly considered\" by the Sudanese government.\n\"Indeed, the submission explicitly addressed this issue, asserting that such a reservation carries no legal weight, as the UAE’s actions fundamentally contradict and undermine the core principles of the Genocide Convention - a position affirmed by the International Court of Justice as early as 1951,\" Mahmoud wrote on\nX\n, referring to the court's landmark\nadvisory opinion\nof 1951, although it ruled that reservations to the Genocide Convention are not prohibited.\nMiddle East Eye delivers independent and unrivalled coverage and analysis of the Middle East, North Africa and beyond.
