IX Reservations to the Genocide Convention Are Here To Stay: A Response to Diamond\n14.03.25\n|\n0 Comments\n[Michael A Becker is Assistant Professor of International and European Human Rights Law at Trinity College Dublin]\nOn 5 March 2025,\nSudan instituted proceedings\nagainst the United Arab Emirates (UAE) at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in relation to alleged violations of the\n1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide\n. Based on allegations that UAE is supporting genocidal acts by the Rapid Support Forces in West Darfur against the Masalit group, Sudan’s claims raise important questions about the nature and scope of complicity in genocide. Nonetheless, it is very unlikely that any of these factual allegations or legal claims will be heard or decided by the ICJ. Because the UAE made a reservation to Article IX when it acceded to the Genocide Convention in 2005, the ICJ can be expected to conclude that it lacks jurisdiction over the dispute. Art. IX is the provision by which states consent to ICJ jurisdiction over disputes relating to the interpretation, application, or fulfilment of the treaty.\nThis makes the recent\nOpinio Juris\npost by Yonah Diamond\n(“The Invalidity of Art. IX Reservations to the Genocide Convention”\n) especially timely. Sudan has\nsuggested\nthat it will seek to challenge UAE’s Art. IX reservation on the basis such reservations are incompatible with the object and purpose of the Genocide Convention. This is also the argument that Diamond sets out to make. However, Diamond takes a normative position on the undesirability of Art. IX reservations that fails to take a full view of the relevant history surrounding the validity of such reservations or the doctrinal basis for preserving the status quo.\nDecades of practice at the ICJ support the view that Art. IX reservations are valid as a matter of treaty law. In 1951, the\nReservations to the Genocide Convention\nadvisory opinion established the principle that reservations are permissible unless incompatible with the treaty’s object and purpose. The question arose precisely because so many states that sought to join the newly-adopted Genocide Convention had made Art. IX reservations when doing so. The rule articulated by the ICJ (later codified in Article 19 of the\n1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties\n) paved the way for those reserving states to be considered parties to the Genocide Convention and confirmed the treaty’s entry into force. Ultimately, the Court treated reservations (including to Art IX) as the necessary cost to obtaining as wide a degree of participation as possible. In contentious cases since then, the Court has not questioned the validity of Art. IX reservations. Consider the Court’s acceptance of the validity of Art. IX reservations in the 1999\nLegality of Use of Force\ncases against\nSpain\nand the\nUnited States\n, as affirmed more recently in the\n5 June 2023 Order on the Admissibility of the Declarations of Intervention\nin\nUkraine v Russia\n(see paras 93-96).\nDiamond does briefly mention\nArmed Activities on the Territory of the Congo\n, where the ICJ in 2006 directly rejected the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s challenge to the validity of Rwanda’s Art. IX reservation (see paras 64-69) . In Diamond’s view, the Court ‘evidently erred’ in delineating the treaty’s object and purpose based on a substantive/procedural distinction and by failing to credit the jus cogens status of the genocide prohibition. One can disagree with the Court’s reasoning, but I don’t see how we can describe this as manifest error. Diamond’s argument seems to be that recourse to the ICJ is the only practical means to implement or enforce the Genocide Convention. Despite the uptick in ICJ cases relating to the Genocide Convention, this is not the case. In principle, acting pursuant to Article VIII of the Genocide Convention, states can turn to the UN General Assembly, the UN Security Council, or the UN Human Rights Council. Compliance might also be pursued through domestic courts or by recourse to countermeasures. Some states might also believe that the goals of the Genocide Convention are best pursued through international criminal law and, in particular, the International Criminal Court.\nIn short, a judgment by the ICJ is not the only means to seek to give effect to the substantive obligations set forth in the Genocide Convention. I am not claiming that any of these alternative methods is likely to be especially effective (or at least any more effective that ICJ litigation). But they exist, and I think the ICJ was correct in 2006 to note that opting out of ICJ dispute settlement does not inherently compromise the goal of preventing and punishing the crime of genocide (even if it might make prevention and accountability more difficult, and even if it is preferable for states to accept Art. IX).\nUltimately, Diamond is making a normative argument that Art. IX reservations should be deemed invalid, at least based on developments since the 2006 judgment in\nArmed Activities (DRC v Rwanda)\n. Yet from a doctrinal perspective, the fact that the ICJ has confirmed the standing of non-injured states to bring Genocide Convention cases (see, e.g., the\n2022 judgment on preliminary objections in The Gambia v Myanmar\n(paras 106-114)) does not bear on the validity of Art. IX reservations. The same goes for the phenomenon of “\nmass intervention\n” by third states in these cases. These notable trends are not sufficient to establish a peremptory norm of general international law “requiring a State to consent to the jurisdiction of the Court to settle a dispute relating to the Genocide Convention”, as the Court put it in\nArmed Activities\n(\npara 69\n). The fact that many states see the ICJ as an important and (maybe) useful way to seek compliance with the Genocide Convention does not in and of itself mean that Art. IX reservations are incompatible (or are no longer compatible) with the treaty’s broader goals.\nThis is not to say that the validity of Art. IX reservations has not been contentious (including among ICJ judges), and Diamond notes correctly that some states have lodged objections to Art. IX reservations at various times. However, the majority of states parties to the Genocide Convention have not done so (including Sudan, which did not object to UAE’s Art. IX objection at the relevant time). Whether state practice of this sort should be the ultimate arbiter of a treaty’s object and purpose is debatable, but this record of tacit acceptance weighs against Diamond’s position.  Taking a broader view, it remains the case that most international human rights treaties treat third-party dispute settlement as optional (and sometimes make this explicit, as in Article 30(2) of the\n1984 Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment\n). Given the substantive similarities between the Genocide Convention and the Torture Convention, the optional nature of ICJ dispute settlement under the Torture Convention further undercuts the argument that Art. IX reservations are inherently incompatible with the object and purpose of the Genocide Convention.\nDiamond’s piece closes by describing Art. IX reservations as a technicality. This strikes me as unfortunate. It may be that some states parties to the Genocide Convention would never have ratified or acceded to the treaty without the possibility of excluding ICJ dispute settlement. If the ICJ were asked to address this question today (as may happen in the new proceedings instituted by Sudan), the ICJ would be wise to proceed in a manner consistent with its past practice—an approach that gives primacy to state consent. Indeed, this may be an especially inopportune moment to take steps that might further destabilize an\ninternational legal system already facing very serious threats and dramatic change\n.\nNone of this means that I endorse the possibility of giving states the option to withhold their consent to third-party dispute settlement as a general matter. In a world in which\ninternational affairs are far more judicialized\nthan they were in 1948, it should generally be feasible and good policy to treat the acceptance of compulsory dispute settlement as the ‘price of admission’ to human rights treaty regimes. But this neither can nor should undo decades of practice under the 1948 Genocide Convention, which has cemented the optional nature of ICJ dispute settlement under that instrument.\nTopics\nFeatured\n,\nGeneral\nShare\nEmail\nTwitter\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nWhatsApp\nPrint\nTags:\nGenocide Convention\n,\nICJ\n,\ntreaty reservation\nRelated\nLeave a Reply\nPlease\nLogin\nto comment\nThis comment form is under antispam protection\nThis comment form is under antispam protection\nSubscribe\nNotify of\nnew follow-up comments\nnew replies to my comments\nAbout Author\nMichael A Becker\nRecent Posts\nEvents and Announcements: 16 March 2025\nArt.

Sudan accused the UAE of complicity in alleged genocide against the Masalit ethnic group.\n\nThe complaint centres on the actions of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and allied militias, which Sudan alleges have committed acts of genocide, murder, theft, rape, forcible displacement and other human rights violations.\n\nSudan claims these acts were carried out with the direct support of the UAE, including the supply of weapons, artillery, ammunition, drones and other military equipment. Sudan further alleges the UAE sent its own agents and mercenaries to assist the RSF.\n\nThe complaint details the impact of the conflict, stating that violence has disrupted agricultural projects, factory production, and access to healthcare and education. Sudan alleges that the UAE's support for the RSF has led to the deaths of thousands of civilians, the displacement of millions, and the widespread destruction of property.\n\nSudan's case is based on Article 36, paragraph 1, of the ICJ Statute and Article IX of the Genocide Convention, to which both countries are signatories.\n\nThe UAE, however, made a reservation upon acceding to the Genocide Convention, seeking to exclude disputes under the Convention from the ICJ's jurisdiction. Sudan argues this reservation is invalid as it is incompatible with the Convention's object and purpose.\n\nAlongside the lawsuit, Sudan has requested the ICJ impose provisional measures to protect the Masalit population. These include an order for the UAE to cease all support for the RSF and to take steps to prevent further acts of genocide. Sudan argues for the urgency of these measures, citing the ongoing nature of the alleged genocide and the risk of irreparable harm.\n\nThe ICJ, also known as the World Court, has acknowledged the urgency and will prioritize Sudan's request for provisional measures.",

The violence, fueled by ethnic and tribal divisions, can be\ntraced back\nto the rule of former president Omar al-Bashir lasting from 1989 to 2019 before being ousted in a popular revolution. A fragile civilian-military coalition ensued but it soon collapsed under a military coup led by al-Burhan in October 2021.\nFollowing the coup, tensions increased between the military and the RSF, especially over plans to\nintegrate\nthe latter into the army. This\nculminated\non April 15, 2023, when RSF units launched coordinated attacks on SAF targets, including in key locations in the capital Khartoum, marking the beginning of the war.\nThe RSF, originally formed from the Janjaweed militias accused of atrocities in Darfur during the early 2000s, has been implicated in severe human rights violations, including attacks on the Masalit community in West Darfur.\nAccording to\ndata\nfrom the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED), by the end of November 2024, over 28,000 people have been killed, though some estimate that the real number is far higher and could be as high as\n150,000\n.\nRecent numbers from the International Organization for Migration\nestimate\nthat more than 14 million Sudanese have been displaced since the beginning of the fighting in April 2023, including more than 3.5 million who have crossed the borders to seek refuge in neighboring countries. That is almost 30 percent of the total population of the country with\nhalf\nthe population in need of humanitarian help.\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) has accused both warring parties of bombing populated areas indiscriminately, with RSF “deliberately targeting hospitals,”\naccording\nto Mohamed Osman, researcher for their Africa division.\nThe UAE's role in other conflicts\nBeyond Sudan, the UAE has faced scrutiny for its involvement in various regional conflicts. In Yemen, the UAE has been a key member of the Saudi-led coalition against Houthi rebels, a campaign\ncriticized\nfor causing civilian casualties and a humanitarian disaster.\nAdditionally, reports have emerged of the UAE\nsupplying\narms to factions in Libya, further destabilizing the region. These actions have raised concerns about the UAE's adherence to international law and its role in perpetuating conflicts across West Asia and North Africa.​\nThe UAE's relationship with Israel has evolved significantly since the signing of the\nAbraham Accords\nin 2020, normalizing relations between the two countries. Despite Israel's military actions in Gaza, which have been described as a genocide by various\nexperts\nand\nhuman rights organizations\nand ruled as a\nplausible\ncase of genocide by the ICJ, the UAE has\nmaintained\nand expanded its diplomatic, economic and military ties with Israel, including helping Israel\nbypass\nthe naval blockade through setting up a route from Dubai to Haifa.\nIn February this year, a video of the UAE ambassador to the US saying that he saw “no alternative” to Donald Trump’s plan to ethnically cleanse Gaza’s Palestinian population caused outrage.\nThe UAE ambassador to the US said on Wednesday that he saw “no alternative” to Trump’s plan to expel Gaza’s population and redevelop the strip.\nThough the prospect of ethnic cleansing caused global outrage, the UAE called it “difficult” but pointed to a lack of other options.\npic.twitter.com/Zsbg4yjJcZ\n— Middle East Eye (@MiddleEastEye)\nFebruary 13, 2025\nChallenges to the ICJ\nSudan's case against the UAE at the ICJ highlights the complexities of international relations and the growing challenges of holding states accountable for their involvement in foreign conflicts. This comes at a time of\nunprecedented\nviolence and\nimpunity\n, as international law and institutions face systematic\nerosion\nsince the establishment of the UN.\nIn March 2025, the ICJ\nelected\nJapanese judge Yuji Iwasawa as its new president. The Sudan vs. UAE case coincides with another major genocide accusation at the court — South Africa's case against Israel over its actions in Gaza. It is the\nseventh\ngenocide case brought before the ICJ, two of which pertain to the ongoing war in Gaza.\nThe outcome of Sudan’s case against the UAE could set a significant precedent for international law, particularly regarding state complicity in human rights violations. As proceedings unfold, the international community will closely watch how the ICJ navigates these complex legal and ethical issues amid growing\nattacks\non international institutions and courts, particularly from the US and\nsome\nof its allies.\nCategories\nRegions\nSub-Saharan Africa\nWest Asia & North Africa\nSudan\nUnited Arab Emirates\nTopics\nHuman Rights\nHumanitarian Response\nInternational Relations\nPolitics\nWar & Conflict\nA region on the brink: The global implications of the war on Gaza\nWritten by\nWalid El Houri\nSupport our work\nGlobal Voices\nstands out as one of the earliest and strongest examples of how media committed to building community and defending human rights can positively influence how people experience events happening beyond their own communities and national borders.\nPlease consider making a donation to help us continue this work.\nDonate now\nRecent Sub-Saharan Africa Stories\nAfrican Union: Mahmoud Ali Youssouf elected as new commission chairperson\nWritten by\nJean Sovon\nTranslated by\nLaura\n11 hours ago\nTackling adolescent malnutrition in Nigeria’s internally displaced persons (IDP) camps\nWritten by\nAdesewa Olofinko\n2 days ago\nQ&A: Meet Musah Fuseini, Dagbani language activist\nWritten by\nSubhashish Panigrahi\n3 days ago\nMore »\nTop World Stories\nHow the Income Tax department’s actions undermine India’s democratic foundations\nWritten by\nKanav Narayan Sahgal\n2 days ago\nFrom visa-free to visa fees, the UK's new requirements for Trinidad & Tobago nationals stir debate\nWritten by\nJanine Mendes-Franco\n3 days ago\nFour key points to understand El Salvador in 2025\nWritten by\nValeria Cortez\nTranslated by\nMelissa Vida\n4 days ago\nCancel this reply\nStart the conversation\nAuthors, please\nlog in »\nName (required)\nEmail (will not be published) (required)\nWebsite\nSubscribe to comments on this post via email\nGuidelines\nAll comments are reviewed by a moderator\n.

    "cleaned_text_content": "Another test for international justice: Sudan takes the UAE to the ICJ over its complicity in genocide\n\nWritten by Walid El Houri\nPosted 15 March 2025 17:57 GMT\n\nScreenshot from video uploaded to X.com by user @Aleisir on October 8, 2024 showing UAE ammunition captured by the SAF. Fair use.\n\nOn March 6, 2025, Sudan initiated legal proceedings against the United Arab Emirates (UAE) at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), accusing the UAE of breaching the Genocide Convention by supporting the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group implicated in atrocities against the Masalit people in Sudan's West Darfur region. The UAE has denied the accusations.\n\nHistorical accusations\n\nThe allegations against the UAE are not isolated. In October 2024, the RSF mistakenly shot down a military plane in Sudan's Malha region, killing two Russian crew members and three Sudanese on board. The Conflict Observatory identified the aircraft as an Ilyushin Il-76, affiliated with Kyrgyzstan's New Way Cargo, suggesting involvement in arms shipments from the UAE to the RSF. Identity documents found at the crash site included a passport and an ID of a Russian linked to a UAE-based company, Airline Transport Incorporation FZC. ​\n\nPrior to this incident the Sudanese government had been repeatedly accusing the UAE of arming the RSF and prolonging the war while profiting from “the illegal exploitation of gold.”\n\nIn October 2024, Khalid Ali Aleisir, Minister of Culture and Information in Sudan shared a video of what he claimed was evidence of UAE supplying weapons to the RSF:\n\nFollowing their victory and control over the Jebel Moya area, the Sudanese Armed Forces discovered Emirati military equipment supplied to the rebel militia, along with various types of Emirati weapons, ammunition, and medical supplies.\nNew evidence reveals the UAE's involvement…\npic.twitter.com/975qKLHJdK\n— Khalid Ali خالد علي (الإعيسر) (@Aleisir) October 8, 2024\n\nContext of the war\n\nThe almost two-year-long round of violence is the fourth civil war in the country’s history. The violence, fueled by ethnic and tribal divisions, can be traced back to the rule of former president Omar al-Bashir lasting from 1989 to 2019 before being ousted in a popular revolution. A fragile civilian-military coalition ensued but it soon collapsed under a military coup led by al-Burhan in October 2021.\n\nFollowing the coup, tensions increased between the military and the RSF, especially over plans to integrate the latter into the army. This culminated on April 15, 2023, when RSF units launched coordinated attacks on SAF targets, including in key locations in the capital Khartoum, marking the beginning of the war.\n\nThe RSF, originally formed from the Janjaweed militias accused of atrocities in Darfur during the early 2000s, has been implicated in severe human rights violations, including attacks on the Masalit community in West Darfur.\n\nAccording to data from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED), by the end of November 2024, over 28,000 people have been killed, though some estimate that the real number is far higher and could be as high as 150,000.\n\nRecent numbers from the International Organization for Migration estimate that more than 14 million Sudanese have been displaced since the beginning of the fighting in April 2023, including more than 3.5 million who have crossed the borders to seek refuge in neighboring countries. That is almost 30 percent of the total population of the country with half the population in need of humanitarian help.\n\nHuman Rights Watch (HRW) has accused both warring parties of bombing populated areas indiscriminately, with RSF “deliberately targeting hospitals,” according to Mohamed Osman, researcher for their Africa division.\n\nThe UAE's role in other conflicts\n\nBeyond Sudan, the UAE has faced scrutiny for its involvement in various regional conflicts. In Yemen, the UAE has been a key member of the Saudi-led coalition against Houthi rebels, a campaign criticized for causing civilian casualties and a humanitarian disaster.\n\nAdditionally, reports have emerged of the UAE supplying arms to factions in Libya, further destabilizing the region. These actions have raised concerns about the UAE's adherence to international law and its role in perpetuating conflicts across West Asia and North Africa.​\n\nThe UAE's relationship with Israel has evolved significantly since the signing of the Abraham Accords in 2020, normalizing relations between the two countries. Despite Israel's military actions in Gaza, which have been described as a genocide by various experts and human rights organizations and ruled as a plausible case of genocide by the ICJ, the UAE has maintained and expanded its diplomatic, economic and military ties with Israel, including helping Israel bypass the naval blockade through setting up a route from Dubai to Haifa.\n\nIn February this year, a video of the UAE ambassador to the US saying that he saw “no alternative” to Donald Trump’s plan to ethnically cleanse Gaza’s Palestinian population caused outrage.\n\nThe UAE ambassador to the US said on Wednesday that he saw “no alternative” to Trump’s plan to expel Gaza’s population and redevelop the strip. Though the prospect of ethnic cleansing caused global outrage, the UAE called it “difficult” but pointed to a lack of other options. pic.twitter.com/Zsbg4yjJcZ — Middle East Eye (@MiddleEastEye) February 13, 2025\n\nChallenges to the ICJ\n\nSudan's case against the UAE at the ICJ highlights the complexities of international relations and the growing challenges of holding states accountable for their involvement in foreign conflicts. This comes at a time of unprecedented violence and impunity, as international law and institutions face systematic erosion since the establishment of the UN.\n\nIn March 2025, the ICJ elected Japanese judge Yuji Iwasawa as its new president. The Sudan vs. UAE case coincides with another major genocide accusation at the court — South Africa's case against Israel over its actions in Gaza. It is the seventh genocide case brought before the ICJ, two of which pertain to the ongoing war in Gaza.\n\nThe outcome of Sudan’s case against the UAE could set a significant precedent for international law, particularly regarding state complicity in human rights violations. As proceedings unfold, the international community will closely watch how the ICJ navigates these complex legal and ethical issues amid growing attacks on international institutions and courts, particularly from the US and some of its allies.\n",

[+]\n'UAE OUT OF SUDAN' during the demonstration in London, UK, in October 2024. Protesters gathered across from Downing Street to oppose the UAE's alleged support of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan, accusing it of complicity in genocide. They called for an end to Sudanese suffering and demanded that the UAE withdraw its support. The event was organized by Action For Sudan, a group advocating for human rights, justice, and self-determination for the Sudanese people. (Photo credit:  Martin Pope/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)\nSOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images\nOn March 5, 2025, Sudan\nfiled\nan\napplication\ninstituting proceedings against the United Arab Emirates (UAE) before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) with regard to a dispute concerning alleged violations by the UAE of its obligations under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Genocide Convention) in relation to the Masalit group in Sudan, most notably in West Darfur. The ICJ is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations. The ICJ has a twofold role: first, to settle, in accordance with international law, legal disputes submitted to it by States; and, second, to give advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by duly authorized United Nations organs and agencies of the system.\nSudan’s application concerns “acts which have been perpetrated by (…) Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and militias allied with it, including, but not limited to, genocide, murder, theft of property, rape, forcible displacement, trespassing, vandalism of public properties, and violation of human rights.” According to the application, all such acts have been “perpetrated and enabled by the direct support given to the rebel RSF militia and related militia groups by the United Arab Emirates.” The application also concerns “acts adopted, condoned, taken, and being taken by the Government of the UAE in connection with the genocide against the Masalit group in the Republic of the Sudan since at least 2023.” Sudan submitted that the UAE “is complicit in the genocide on the Masalit through its direction of and provision of extensive financial, political, and military support for the rebel RSF militia.”\nThe Masalit are a small ethnic minority group in western Sudan (and also in Chad). The United Nations\nreported\non several attacks against the groups, including in November 2023, when hundreds of ethnic Masalit civilians were reportedly killed in Ardamata town, West Darfur, by the RSF and their allied Arab militia. The RSF has its roots in the Janjaweed militias, and some of its leaders\nface outstanding war crimes\nand atrocity crimes charges. Apart from mass killings, rape and other forms of sexual violence have been a common weapon of war against the ethnic minority group.

Sudan and the UAE are both signatories of the 1948 Genocide Convention.\n\nSudan is asking the court to impose emergency measures and to order the Emirates to prevent such genocidal acts.\n\nWhile a hearing on the emergency measures should come before the ICJ within weeks, it will take years before the court will issue a final ruling which could determine if a genocide had been committed in Darfur.\n\nThe RSF and allied political groups are in the process of setting up a parallel government to the army-aligned one which has taken Port Sudan on the Red Sea.\n",

Forensic evidence, including a\nreport\nfrom the Raoul Wallenberg Centre for Human Rights and a separate Human Rights Watch\nreport\n, has detailed the RSF’s systematic killings, sexual violence, and incineration of whole villages in West Darfur. Satellite imagery analyzed by Yale University’s Humanitarian Research Lab\nexposes\nthe widespread destruction of civilian settlements.\nThe United Nations’ report on the\ndiscovery of mass graves\nfollowing RSF attacks further reinforces the evidence.\nSurvivor accounts\ndescribe RSF fighters targeting the Masalit for their ethnicity, chanting racial slurs while executing civilians, including children, which demonstrates clear evidence of genocidal intent. The U.S. State Department’s January\ndesignation\nof RSF actions as genocide, though tardy under the Biden administration, aligns with these findings.\nThe UAE’s role is not conjecture but a matter of meticulously documented fact. In January 2024, the U.N. Security Council’s Panel of Experts\nreported\ncredible evidence of UAE involvement and weapons supply to the RSF via its Amdjarass base in Chad.\nFlight tracking data and satellite images analyzed by the Conflict Observatory, a U.S. nongovernmental organization that verifies reports of war crimes in Sudan and Ukraine,\nconcluded\nwith “near certainty” that the UAE transferred weapons to the RSF. Reuters\nreported\nthat there were at least 86 flights from the UAE to Amdjarass since the war began, with three-quarters operated by carriers previously linked to arms trafficking.\nThe\nNew York Times\nexposed\na secret Emirati drone base at the Amdjarass airport, near the Sudanese border, that supported the RSF. The investigation uncovered long-range Chinese-made Wing Loong drones that were launched from an upgraded airstrip disguised as a humanitarian project tied to an Emirati-run Red Crescent hospital. Drone-equipped militias had\nhigher civilian fatality rates\nin urban confrontations.\nThe UAE’s financial and diplomatic heft compounds the challenge. Its oil and trade-based soft power and $569 billion GDP make it far more powerful than Sudan’s $30 billion economy, and its close ties with Western governments make matters worse.\nU.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen and Rep. Sara Jacobs, who\nattempted to block\na $1.2 billion arms deal with the UAE last year,\nconfirmed\nin January that the UAE reneged on pledges to halt support to the RSF, per Biden administration briefings—a breach that has enabled the RSF to kill thousands.\nAmid a weakened international justice system, exemplified by recent\nU.S. sanctions\non the International Criminal Court, this case will test whether global courts will hold powerful states accountable or succumb to political and procedural pressures.\nIn December 2023, South Africa\ninitiated\nlegal action against Israel at the ICJ, charging it with genocide in Gaza. Several countries from the global south have enthusiastically supported South Africa’s case, including Algeria, Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, and Pakistan. This marked a pivotal moment of global south solidarity. South Africa’s case against Israel leveraged its moral legacy of anti-apartheid activism and anti-colonialism.\nSudan’s recent history lacks such advantages, but its current crisis lays bare the grave challenges of many postcolonial states, including exploitation by internal and external forces. The current conflict—marked by massive civilian suffering, displacement, targeted violence, and the collapse of state institutions—stands as one of the gravest humanitarian and political crises of our time. However, it is not simply a\ndomestic conflict\n; rather, it is a manifestation of international neglect, regional manipulation, and the continued marginalization of Africa.\nIf the countries that backed South Africa fail to lend similar support to Sudan, it would undermine the integrity of the principles upon which global south solidarity is built. It would risk reinforcing the very asymmetries of the application of international law, where justice is selectively weaponized by great powers while systematically denied to the vulnerable.\nSupporting the case against the UAE should not be conflated with backing the Sudanese government in its conflict with the RSF. The record of the SAF is not unblemished. The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED)\nfound\nthat the SAF were responsible for approximately 200 incidents involving civilian casualties in 2024, compared to around 1,300 events attributed to the RSF.\nWhile SAF casualties are often framed as collateral damage in counterinsurgency operations, this does not absolve the army of responsibility for harm or their duty to minimize it. Moreover, the Sudanese government’s bureaucratic obstacles to humanitarian aid have exacerbated what is now regarded as the\nworst humanitarian disaster\nin modern history.\nInstead, support for Sudan’s case should be grounded in principle. The UAE’s extensive patronage networks, underpinned by its oil wealth and influence, as well as its strategic alignments with both Western and non-Western powers, make its alleged violations even more consequential: An unchecked UAE, emboldened by impunity, will continue to manipulate regional conflicts—from Sudan, to Libya, to Yemen, to Syria—undermining many sovereign states in the global south in its quest for resources and influence.\nThe stakes are extremely high\nfor the international justice system. A successful ruling could reinvigorate the ICJ’s credibility, but that will require widespread support in the same spirit that animated support for South Africa’s case against Israel.\nThe UAE will no doubt hide behind its reservation to Article IX of the Genocide Convention, which establishes the ICJ’s jurisdiction over the convention’s implementation. However,\nlegal scholars\nhave\nchallenged\nthe validity of reservations to Article IX because they contradict the spirit of the convention and\nshield\nstates from accountability. The ICJ itself issued an\nadvisory opinion\nin 1951, stating that reservations to treaties such as the Genocide Convention could only be accepted if they did not conflict with the object and purpose of the treaty, which aims to prevent and punish genocide.\nBy failing to decisively back Sudan, the nations of the global south will leave a power vacuum, inviting exploitation by stronger actors for military basing, resource extraction, or geopolitical leverage.\nIndeed, if they ignore Sudan’s grievances, their silence will cement a paradigm in which wealth and power trump accountability, leaving Sudanese victims as collateral damage in a geopolitical game.\nAmgad Fareid Eltayeb\nis a former assistant chief of staff to Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, serving in that role from January 2020 to February 2021.\nRead More On\nGenocide & Crimes Against Humanity\n|\nInternational Organizations\n|\nLaw\n|\nMigration and Immigration\n|\nSudan\n|\nUnited Arab Emirates\nJoin the Conversation\nCommenting on this and other recent articles is just one benefit of a\nForeign Policy\nsubscription.\nAlready a subscriber?\nLog In\n.\nSubscribe\nSubscribe\nView\nComments\nJoin the Conversation\nJoin the conversation on this and other recent\nForeign Policy\narticles when you subscribe now.\nSubscribe\nSubscribe\nNot your account?\nLog out\nView\nComments\nJoin the Conversation\nPlease follow our\ncomment guidelines\n, stay on topic, and be civil, courteous, and respectful of others’ beliefs.\nYou are commenting as\n.\nChange your username\n|\nLog out\nChange your username:\nUsername\nI agree to abide by FP’s\ncomment guidelines\n.

This marked a pivotal moment of global south solidarity. South Africa’s case against Israel leveraged its moral legacy of anti-apartheid activism and anti-colonialism.\nSudan’s recent history lacks such advantages, but its current crisis lays bare the grave challenges of many postcolonial states, including exploitation by internal and external forces. The current conflict—marked by massive civilian suffering, displacement, targeted violence, and the collapse of state institutions—stands as one of the gravest humanitarian and political crises of our time.

The record of the SAF is not unblemished. The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data (ACLED)\nfound\nthat the SAF were responsible for approximately 200 incidents involving civilian casualties in 2024, compared to around 1,300 events attributed to the RSF.\nWhile SAF casualties are often framed as collateral damage in counterinsurgency operations, this does not absolve the army of responsibility for harm or their duty to minimize it. Moreover, the Sudanese government’s bureaucratic obstacles to humanitarian aid have exacerbated what is now regarded as the\nworst humanitarian disaster\nin modern history.\nInstead, support for Sudan’s case should be grounded in principle. The UAE’s extensive patronage networks, underpinned by its oil wealth and influence, as well as its strategic alignments with both Western and non-Western powers, make its alleged violations even more consequential: An unchecked UAE, emboldened by impunity, will continue to manipulate regional conflicts—from Sudan, to Libya, to Yemen, to Syria—undermining many sovereign states in the global south in its quest for resources and influence.\nThe stakes are extremely high\nfor the international justice system. A successful ruling could reinvigorate the ICJ’s credibility, but that will require widespread support in the same spirit that animated support for South Africa’s case against Israel.\nThe UAE will no doubt hide behind its reservation to Article IX of the Genocide Convention, which establishes the ICJ’s jurisdiction over the convention’s implementation.

    "text_content": "Cairo (AFP) – Sudan has accused the United Arab Emirates of complicity in genocide in a filing at the International Court of Justice, putting the spotlight on the oil-rich monarchy's alleged involvement in a devastating civil war.\n\nIssued on: 08/03/2025 - 11:01 Modified: 08/03/2025 - 10:59\n\nThe UAE has long been accused by Sudan and others of supporting the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which have been fighting the regular army for nearly two years -- an allegation the Gulf state denies.\n\nHow is the UAE involved in Sudan, and what ties does it have to the RSF?\nWhy is Sudan important to the UAE?\n\nOne of Africa's largest countries, Sudan has a wealth of natural resources including vast agricultural lands, gas and gold, of which it is the continent's third-largest producer.\n\nIt neighbours Libya, where Abu Dhabi backs the rebel authorities, and has a coastline on the Red Sea -- a crucial maritime route for oil shipping.\n\nIn 2021, Sudan's army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan seized power in a coup alongside his deputy, RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, known as Hemeti.\n\nTwo years later fighting erupted between the two generals, with powers including the UAE, Egypt, Turkey, Iran and Russia accused of supporting one side or the other.\n\n\"The primary goal for the UAE in Sudan has been about political influence in a strategically very important country,\" said Andreas Krieg, a Middle East security specialist at King's College London.\n\nEmirati state-affiliated companies look at Sudan as a hub for investment in resources, minerals and trade more generally, he said.\n\nSudan researcher Hamid Khalafallah said the desert UAE is interested in natural resources it lacks, including minerals and arable land.\n\nFrom Libya to Somalia, \"we see a pattern of the UAE working with paramilitaries\" to exploit the continent's resources, he said.\n\nDevelopment group Swissaid estimated in a report last year that in 2022, 66.5 percent of African gold exports to the UAE had been smuggled out.\n\nThe UAE, a major hub for the gold trade, is the world's top buyer of the precious metal from Sudan, a sector largely controlled by Daglo.\n\nBut Federico Donelli, a professor of international relations at Italy's University of Trieste, said it would be \"too simplistic\" to say the UAE's interests were all about gold.\n\nAbu Dhabi is also seeking to counter Saudi influence in Sudan and prevent the spread of political Islam, which it sees as a threat to its security, he said.\nWhat links to the RSF?\n\nGulf ties to Sudan's military stem from cooperation in Yemen, after Khartoum joined the Saudi-led coalition fighting a civil war there in 2015.\n\nBurhan led the Sudanese who fought under the Saudis, while Daglo's RSF were deployed with soldiers from the UAE, Donelli earlier told the Nordic Africa Institute.\n\nRifts have since emerged between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, traditionally close allies. UAE support for Daglo, though denied by the Emiratis, serves \"to challenge Saudi objectives\", Donelli said.\n\nThe relationship is also ideological, with the RSF willing to contain the Muslim Brotherhood political movement, which is outlawed by the UAE and other Arab states, Krieg said.\n\nThis sets the RSF apart from the army, which has been linked with remnants of the Islamist regime of former dictator Omar al-Bashir.\n\nBoth sides have faced claims of war crimes during Sudan's bitter conflict, which has killed tens of thousands of people and uprooted more than 12 million.\n\nBut in January, Washington accused the RSF of genocide for targeting ethnic groups with mass killings and gang rapes.\n\nAlso in January, two US lawmakers said the UAE had broken its promises to stop providing military aid to the RSF.\n\nDaglo's private finances are run from the UAE, Krieg said, adding that he had become \"co-dependent\" on Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe RSF has received crucial support from the UAE, including arms deliveries through neighbouring Chad, diplomats, analysts and human rights groups say.\n\nThe UAE denies the allegations.\nWill the case affect the UAE?\n\nSudan filed its case against the UAE at the ICJ, the top UN court in The Hague, on Thursday, claiming complicity in genocide over Abu Dhabi's alleged support for the RSF.\n\nThe UAE dismissed the case as a \"publicity stunt\" and said it would try to have it thrown out.\n\nICJ rulings are legally binding, but the court has no power to enforce them.\n\nDonelli said the case was likely to cause reputational damage to the UAE.\n\n\"Both internationally and within Africa, there is an increasing perception of the Emirates as a destabilising actor,\" he told AFP.\n\nBut \"the financial and political prominence that the UAE has gained over the past decade will likely shield it from any serious repercussions\".",

The UAE called the filing a publicity stunt and said it would seek to have the case dismissed.\nThe International Court of Justice said Sudan’s case, filed Wednesday, concerns acts allegedly perpetrated by the Rapid Support Forces and allied militias including “genocide, murder, theft of property, rape, forcible displacement, trespassing, vandalism of public properties, and violation of human rights” targeting the Masalit people.\nThe United Arab Emirates issued a statement after the filing asserting the case was a “nothing more than a cynical publicity stunt.”\nThe filing is “aimed at diverting attention from the established complicity of the Sudanese Armed Forces in the widespread atrocities that continue to devastate Sudan and its people,” the UAE statement said, referring to the government-backed forces fighting in the war.\nRELATED COVERAGE\nSudanese police accuse RSF paramilitaries after 11 bodies found at bottom of a well in Khartoum\nAP Exclusive: US and Israel look to Africa for moving Palestinians uprooted from Gaza\nUN: Sudan war is world’s worst humanitarian crisis: 30 million need aid, 16 million of them kids\nBoth the RSF and the Sudanese military have been accused of abuses in the war.\nThe UAE statement said the allegations in Sudan’s case “lack any legal or factual basis, representing yet another attempt to distract from this calamitous war. Out of respect for the International Court of Justice, as the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, the UAE will seek the immediate dismissal of this baseless application.”\nSudan alleges that the UAE was “complicit in the genocide on the Masalit through its direction of and provision of extensive financial, political, and military support for the rebel RSF militia,” the court said.\nSudan also asked the court to impose urgent interim orders known as provisional measures on the UAE, including doing all it can to prevent the killing and other crimes targeting the Masalit.\nBoth Sudan and the UAE are signatories to the 1948 genocide convention.\nSudan descended into a deadly\nconflict\nin mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary rebels broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions.\nThe war has killed more than 24,000 people and driven over 14 million people — about 30% of the population — from their homes, according to the United Nations. An estimated 3.2 million Sudanese have escaped to neighboring countries.\nThe case at the world court was announced less than two weeks after the Rapid Support Forces and its allies signed a charter that paved the way for the establishment of a parallel government, following recent advances by Sudan’s army against the rival groups.\nThe group Conflict Observatory, which is funded by the U.S. State Department and has been monitoring the war in Sudan, has identified aircraft it says carried UAE arms transfers to the RSF. Those flights went through Aéroport International Maréchal Idriss Deby in Amdjarass, Chad — flights the UAE has claimed have been for supporting a local hospital.\nIn January, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that RSF leader Mohammad Hamdan Daglo Mousa, also known as Hemedti, had been targeted for sanctions along with seven RSF-owned companies in the United Arab Emirates, including one handling gold likely smuggled out of Sudan. That came as the U.S. declared the RSF are committing genocide.\nThe UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula and a U.S. ally, has been repeatedly accused of arming the RSF, something it\nhas strenuously denied\ndespite evidence to the contrary.\nThe UAE said it has been calling for an immediate ceasefire in the war.\n“The Sudanese Armed Forces’ application to the ICJ does not absolve it from its legal and moral responsibility for its criminal acts and the catastrophic humanitarian crisis in the country,” the UAE said.\nTwo decades ago, the Sudanese region of Darfur became synonymous with genocide and war crimes, particularly by the notorious Janjaweed Arab militias, against populations that identify as Central or East African. Up to 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million were driven from their homes.\nRulings by the International Court of Justice, also known as the world court, take years to reach and are legally binding.\n____\nAssociated Press writer Jon Gambrell in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, contributed.\nMost read\nNew Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney seeks alliances in Europe as he deals with Trump\nNASA’s stuck astronauts welcome their newly arrived replacements to the space station\nTrump invokes 18th century law to speed deportations, judge stalls it hours later\nTrump orders strikes on Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen and issues new warning\nWhat to know about El Salvador’s mega-prison after Trump sent hundreds of immigrants there\nThe Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

The claim charges that the UAE has directly supported the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (\nRSF\n) and its associated militia in West Darfur state, violating the\nGenocide Convention\n.\nSudan’s claim against the UAE is based on weapons seized by the Sudanese Armed Forces in active war zones. Sudanese forces reportedly\ndiscovered\nseveral passports of Emirati nationals inside armored personnel carriers and 4×4 combat vehicles that originated in the UAE. According to Sudan, this reveals illegal military and logistical support that has allowed the RSF to commit genocidal acts in West Darfur, including the killings of civilians, and the deprivation of access to medical care and basic necessities.\nSudan also accused the UAE of providing traveling assistance to the RSF’s commander-in-chief and hosting RSF business activities, violating US\nsanctions\n. The US has imposed a series of sanctions against both the RSF and Sudanese Arme Forces. In January this year, the US imposed sanctions on RSF leader “\nHemedti\n” and seven RSF-linked companies based in the UAE for committing genocide.\nThe United Nations has previously confirmed the RSF’s role in grave abuses in Sudan. In October 2024, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Sudan expressed concern over the “\nethnically motivated attacks\n” committed by the RSF in West Darfur. In November 2024, the UN Security Council\nimposed\nsanctions on two RSF leaders over widespread human rights violations.\nThe dispute relates to the fulfillment of the Genocide Convention’s Article III prohibition on “complicity with genocide.” Even though the UAE acceded to the convention, its express\nreservation\nto the dispute resolution clause under Article IX may present a hurdle for the ICJ to assume jurisdiction.\nThe court’s previous divided\nadvisory opinion\nhas left it open for state parties to the convention to decide whether a reservation is compatible with the object and purpose of the convention.\nArguing that Article IX serves as the basis of the ICJ’s jurisdiction, Sudan\nsuggested\nthat submitting disputes of the convention to the ICJ is “one of the prime guarantees of the due fulfillment of the basic obligation to prevent and punish genocide.” Thus, a reservation to the dispute resolution clause is invalid as Sudan contended. Whether the court will assume jurisdiction over the dispute remains to be seen.\nPending final judgment in the case, Sudan\nasked\nfor provision measures, including requiring the UAE to “take all measures within its power” to prevent genocidal acts against Darfur’s Masalit ethnic group.\nIn response, the UAE foreign minister Anwar Gargash\nsaid\non X (formerly Twitter) that Sudan should prioritize a ceasefire in its territory over a “publicity tactic” to justify its rejection of peace.\nFrom\nJURIST\n, March 7.

    "cleaned_text_content": "Sudan sues UAE for complicity in Darfur genocide\nMarch 15, 2025\nJurist\n\nSudan instituted proceedings against the United Arab Emirates (UAE) before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on March 6. The claim charges that the UAE has directly supported the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and its associated militia in West Darfur state, violating the Genocide Convention.\n\nSudan’s claim against the UAE is based on weapons seized by the Sudanese Armed Forces in active war zones. Sudanese forces reportedly discovered several passports of Emirati nationals inside armored personnel carriers and 4×4 combat vehicles that originated in the UAE. According to Sudan, this reveals illegal military and logistical support that has allowed the RSF to commit genocidal acts in West Darfur, including the killings of civilians, and the deprivation of access to medical care and basic necessities.\n\nSudan also accused the UAE of providing traveling assistance to the RSF’s commander-in-chief and hosting RSF business activities, violating US sanctions. The US has imposed a series of sanctions against both the RSF and Sudanese Arme Forces. In January this year, the US imposed sanctions on RSF leader “Hemedti” and seven RSF-linked companies based in the UAE for committing genocide.\n\nThe United Nations has previously confirmed the RSF’s role in grave abuses in Sudan. In October 2024, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Sudan expressed concern over the “ethnically motivated attacks” committed by the RSF in West Darfur. In November 2024, the UN Security Council imposed sanctions on two RSF leaders over widespread human rights violations.\n\nThe dispute relates to the fulfillment of the Genocide Convention’s Article III prohibition on “complicity with genocide.” Even though the UAE acceded to the convention, its express reservation to the dispute resolution clause under Article IX may present a hurdle for the ICJ to assume jurisdiction.\n\nThe court’s previous divided advisory opinion has left it open for state parties to the convention to decide whether a reservation is compatible with the object and purpose of the convention.\n\nArguing that Article IX serves as the basis of the ICJ’s jurisdiction, Sudan suggested that submitting disputes of the convention to the ICJ is “one of the prime guarantees of the due fulfillment of the basic obligation to prevent and punish genocide.” Thus, a reservation to the dispute resolution clause is invalid as Sudan contended. Whether the court will assume jurisdiction over the dispute remains to be seen.\n\nPending final judgment in the case, Sudan asked for provision measures, including requiring the UAE to “take all measures within its power” to prevent genocidal acts against Darfur’s Masalit ethnic group.\n\nIn response, the UAE foreign minister Anwar Gargash said on X (formerly Twitter) that Sudan should prioritize a ceasefire in its territory over a “publicity tactic” to justify its rejection of peace.\n\nFrom JURIST, March 7.

However, a study by American universities estimates the death toll to be around 130,000.\nGenocide Allegations\nOn March 6, the International Court of Justice announced that Sudan had filed a request to bring a case against the UAE regarding allegations of violations under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. The case specifically pertains to the mistreatment of the Masalit people in Sudan, particularly in the western region of Darfur.\nIn its statement, the court added that Sudan's request concerns \"acts committed by\" the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and allied militias, including \"but not limited to, genocide, murder, theft of property, rape, forcible displacement, damage to property, and human rights violations.\"\nAccording to the statement, \"all these acts were committed and facilitated through the direct support provided to the RSF militia and related militia groups by the United Arab Emirates.\"\nSudan’s request also pertains to “actions adopted, approved, and carried out by the Government of the United Arab Emirates concerning the genocide against the Masalit group in the Republic of Sudan since at least 2023.”\nAccording to the statement, Sudan claims that the UAE is \"complicit in the genocide against the Masalit by directing and providing extensive financial, political, and military support to the Rapid Support Forces militia.\"\nIt also noted that the plaintiff (Sudan) seeks to establish the court’s jurisdiction under Article 36, paragraph 1, of the Court’s Statute and Article 9 of the Genocide Convention, to which both Sudan and the UAE are parties.\nProvisional Measures\nAccording to the statement, Sudan requests the court to consider the following interim measures pending a final judgment in the case:\nFirstly, \"In accordance with its obligations under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, with respect to the Massalit in the Republic of Sudan, the United Arab Emirates is required to take all measures within its power to prevent the commission of any acts falling under Article II of this Convention, specifically:\n(a) Killing members of the group.\n(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group.\n(c) Imposing living conditions intended to bring about its total or partial destruction.\n(d) Enforcing measures aimed at preventing reproduction within the group.\"\nSecondly, “The United Arab Emirates, with respect to members of the Massalit group, must ensure that no irregular armed units under its direction or support, nor any organizations or individuals subject to its control, direction, or influence, commit any acts described in point (1) above, or conspire to commit genocide, or directly and publicly incite genocide, or attempt to commit genocide, or engage in complicity in genocide.”\nThe court noted that, in accordance with Article 74 of the Court's Rules, a request for the indication of provisional measures takes precedence over all other matters.\nGeneina Massacre\nThe massacre against the Masalit tribe, allegedly backed and fueled by the UAE's support for the RSF militia, began on the very first day of the war between the army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia.\nOn April 15, 2023, clashes erupted, initially concentrated in Khartoum, but quickly spread to other cities, notably to the town of Geneina, the capital of West Darfur state.\nOn April 24, the true tragedy unfolded around 7 a.m., when the RSF militia launched an assault on the city.\nSudanese army soldiers quickly retreated to their base in the far northeastern corner of Geneina.\nAs they withdrew, the RSF militia turned their weapons on the residents of areas predominantly inhabited by the Masalit tribe.\nAccording to a report by Reuters on September 22, 2023, some members of the RSF militia, their faces concealed, arrived on horseback, motorbikes, or in mud-covered Land Cruisers.\nOn the night of the attack, as recounted by eyewitnesses, the first bodies were buried in a forest graveyard.\nThe flow of bodies continued, with 52 wrapped in blankets being transferred, including 27 men, 16 women, and nine children, who were laid in a row in freshly dug graves.\nAccording to witnesses, the burial continued in the forest graveyard for more than seven weeks, from late April until mid-June 2023.\nThe rectangular plot of land transformed into a sprawling mass grave for no fewer than a thousand residents of Geneina, the vast majority of whom were from the Masalit tribe.\nIn the accounts of witnesses to the massacre, the bloodlust reached its peak, and Geneina became a \"swamp of blood.\" One described the bloodshed during those days to the British agency as \"Judgment Day.\"\nThey added that the danger remained relentless, to the point where they were unable to bury their dead immediately, as Islamic law mandates.\nEthnic Cleansing\nIn the wake of the massacre, human rights reports surfaced, documenting the horrific scale of violations committed against the Masalit tribe by the RSF militia, a now-dominant military force empowered by UAE weapons and support.\nA report by\nHuman Rights Watch\n, published on August 17, 2023, revealed that “the RSF [militia], and its allied militias in Sudan raped dozens of women and girls est Darfur’s capital and those fleeing fighting in recent weeks.”\nThe report stated that \"the attackers targeted people because they were of the Masalit ethnicity, and in some cases, because they were known activists.\"\nIt noted that the RSF militia’s attacks in Geneina had resulted in the deaths of at least thousands of people, leaving behind hundreds of thousands of refugees.\nTirana Hassan, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, stated, \"The widespread atrocities committed in Geneina should serve as a stark reminder of the horrors that can occur in the absence of coordinated action. Governments, the African Union, and the United Nations must act to protect civilians.\"\n\"Targeting the Masalit ethnicity, with the presumed objective—at the very least—of forcing them to permanently flee the region, constitutes ethnic cleansing.\"\n\"The specific context in which the widespread killings took place also raises the possibility that the RSF militia and its allies had the intent to destroy the Masalit people, either in whole or in part, in at least West Darfur, which may suggest that genocide has occurred or is occurring there,\" she added.\nOn May 12, 2024, a panel of UN experts issued a preliminary report on the events, stating that between 10,000 and 15,000 people had been killed. Meanwhile, local lawyers have counted 18,000 dead and 7,000 missing.\nTribal Struggles\nWhen asked about the Masalit people who were subjected to the massacre, it is noted that they are one of the most prominent and ancient tribes settled between western Sudan and eastern Chad, particularly in the state of West Darfur.\nThe Masalit have a rich history, having once been an independent sultanate with its own army and entity.\nThey resisted both French and British colonialism, and their lands were divided under an agreement signed between France and England in 1920, with the Masalit eventually settling in the border region between Sudan and Chad.\nThe majority of the Masalit’s territory lies in the far west of Sudan, with a portion extending along the strip bordering the Republic of Chad.\nThe Masalit tribe and the inhabitants of their lands are Muslims, with at least 145,000 members of the Masalit scattered across Sudan, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\nThe tribe speaks the Masalit language, which is widely spoken, and some also speak the Nilotic Desert language, in addition to Arabic.\nAt the turn of the century, the Masalit tribe was subjected to a genocide similar to the one they are enduring now, at the hands of the Janjaweed militia, which later evolved into the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia.\nIn December 2003, the Masalit tribe issued a global appeal titled “From the Masalit Tribe of Sudan... A Plea for Survival.”\nIn this plea, they called upon the world's collective conscience to save them from the threat of genocide, displacement, and the forcible seizure of their lands.\nReports\nUS-Backed Genocide: Why Has 'Israel' Resumed Its Genocidal War on Gaza?\n‘Your Time’s Up’: Will Trump's Strikes Bring an End to the Houthis in Yemen?\nHow the UK Has More Atheists Than Believers in God\nHow the Trump Administration’s Recent Actions Affect the Future of the Pro-palestine Student Movement\nEgypt and Sudan\nExposing Egypt’s Brutal Prisons and Media Under el-Sisi’s Regime\nUAE-Backed RSF Militia's Genocide Against the Masalit Tribe in Darfur\nWhy Are Saudi Arabia and the UAE Bent on Disarming Gaza’s Resistance?\nTags\ngenocide\nunited arab emirates\ninternational court of justice\nmilitias\nrapid support forces\nRelated Posts\nBorder Tensions: How Can Syria Counter Hezbollah’s Threats?\nMark Carney Succeeds Justin Trudeau: Can His Economic Experience Confront Donald Trump?\nUS-Backed Genocide: Why Has 'Israel' Resumed Its Genocidal War on Gaza?\nHow the UK Has More Atheists Than Believers in God\nMahmoud Khalil’s Arrest: A Crackdown on Free Speech and Political Dissent\nWhy Are Saudi Arabia and the UAE Bent on Disarming Gaza’s Resistance?\nAlso\nIraq’s Sectarian Lens Fuels Crackdown on Dissent and Syrian Refugees\nNetanyahu’s Playbook: Reshaping Israeli Minds with Targeted Media and Extremist Rhetoric\nWhy Did New Syria Commit to Destroying Its Chemical Weapons Stockpile?\nRamadan 18: Massacre Duing 'Suhoor' in Gaza | Infographic\nThe Gulf Cooperation Council's Support for Parallel Entities Threatens Yemen's Legitimate Authority\nHamas Remains in Control Despite War and Destruction\nShare this article:\nHome\nReports\nInterviews\nProfiles\nHashtags\nInfographics\nVideos\nAll right reserved © Al-Estiklal Newspaper 2019–2024\nThursday, March 20, 2025\nAl-Estiklal Newspaper\nPeople want",

blankets being transferred, including 27 men, 16 women, and nine children, who were laid in a row in freshly dug graves.\nAccording to witnesses, the burial continued in the forest graveyard for more than seven weeks, from late April until mid-June 2023.\nThe rectangular plot of land transformed into a sprawling mass grave for no fewer than a thousand residents of Geneina, the vast majority of whom were from the Masalit tribe.\nIn the accounts of witnesses to the massacre, the bloodlust reached its peak, and Geneina became a \"swamp of blood.\" One described the bloodshed during those days to the British agency as \"Judgment Day.\"\nThey added that the danger remained relentless, to the point where they were unable to bury their dead immediately, as Islamic law mandates.\n\nEthnic Cleansing\n\nIn the wake of the massacre, human rights reports surfaced, documenting the horrific scale of violations committed against the Masalit tribe by the RSF militia, a now-dominant military force empowered by UAE weapons and support.\nA report by Human Rights Watch, published on August 17, 2023, revealed that “the RSF [militia], and its allied militias in Sudan raped dozens of women and girls [in] West Darfur’s capital and those fleeing fighting in recent weeks.”\nThe report stated that \"the attackers targeted people because they were of the Masalit ethnicity, and in some cases, because they were known activists.\"\nIt noted that the RSF militia’s attacks in Geneina had resulted in the deaths of at least thousands of people, leaving behind hundreds of thousands of refugees.\nTirana Hassan, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, stated, \"The widespread atrocities committed in Geneina should serve as a stark reminder of the horrors that can occur in the absence of coordinated action. Governments, the African Union, and the United Nations must act to protect civilians.\"\n\"Targeting the Masalit ethnicity, with the presumed objective—at the very least—of forcing them to permanently flee the region, constitutes ethnic cleansing.\"\n\"The specific context in which the widespread killings took place also raises the possibility that the RSF militia and its allies had the intent to destroy the Masalit people, either in whole or in part, in at least West Darfur, which may suggest that genocide has occurred or is occurring there,\" she added.\nOn May 12, 2024, a panel of UN experts issued a preliminary report on the events, stating that between 10,000 and 15,000 people had been killed. Meanwhile, local lawyers have counted 18,000 dead and 7,000 missing.\n\nTribal Struggles\n\nWhen asked about the Masalit people who were subjected to the massacre, it is noted that they are one of the most prominent and ancient tribes settled between western Sudan and eastern Chad, particularly in the state of West Darfur.\nThe Masalit have a rich history, having once been an independent sultanate with its own army and entity.\nThey resisted both French and British colonialism, and their lands were divided under an agreement signed between France and England in 1920, with the Masalit eventually settling in the border region between Sudan and Chad.\nThe majority of the Masalit’s territory lies in the far west of Sudan, with a portion extending along the strip bordering the Republic of Chad.\nThe Masalit tribe and the inhabitants of their lands are Muslims, with at least 145,000 members of the Masalit scattered across Sudan, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.\nThe tribe speaks the Masalit language, which is widely spoken, and some also speak the Nilotic Desert language, in addition to Arabic.\nAt the turn of the century, the Masalit tribe was subjected to a genocide similar to the one they are enduring now, at the hands of the Janjaweed militia, which later evolved into the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) militia.\nIn December 2003, the Masalit tribe issued a global appeal titled “From the Masalit Tribe of Sudan... A Plea for Survival.”\nIn this plea, they called upon the world's collective conscience to save them from the threat of genocide, displacement, and the forcible seizure of their lands.\n",

The International Court of Justice announced Thursday that Sudan accused the UAE of violating the genocide convention by arming and funding the rebel RSF. The Associated Press reports that UAE has described the case as nothing more than a cynical publicity stunt.

Sudan has requested that, pending final judgment, the ICJ indicate provisional measures.\nBoth the application itself, and the request for provisional measures, provide the most recent example of States invoking the Genocide Convention and requiring the World Court to adjudicate on active conflicts across the globe.\nThree Conflicts in Recent Years\nThe conflict in Sudan is the third in recent years to give rise to a dispute before the ICJ which relies on the Genocide Convention dispute.\nFirst, in\nAllegations of Genocide Under the Convention on Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Ukraine v. Russian Federation)\n,\nUkraine asserted that the basis upon which Russia justified its 2022 invasion gave rise to a dispute under the Convention.\nOn\n16 March 2022 the ICJ made an order\nto indicate provisional measures, including (by 13 votes to 2), to require the Russian Federation to “\nimmediately suspend the military operations that it commenced on 24 February 2022 in the territory of Ukraine\n”.\nThe order also, by unanimity, required both Ukraine and the Russian Federation, to “\nrefrain from any action which might aggravate or extend the dispute before the Court or make it more difficult to resolve\n”. The proceedings remain ongoing, and as of early 2025 the Court is seized with the question as to\nwhether or not certain counter-claims made by the Russian Federation are admissible\n.\nSecond, in\nApplication of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in the Gaza Strip (South Africa v. Israel)\n, the Court initially indicated interim measures on 26 January 2024. In a carefully reasoned Order, it concluded that it has\nprima facie\njurisdiction (jurisdiction “on the face of it”) over the dispute, and that South Africa has\nprima facie\nstanding to bring the claim.\nIn one of the more misunderstood aspects of the analysis, the Court also concluded that at least some of the rights asserted by South Africa are plausible (i.e. the right of Palestinians in Gaza to be protected from acts of genocide and related prohibited acts), and that there was a link between those plausible rights and the provisional measures sought. As a result the ICJ indicated certain measures which, in effect, require Israel to comply with the Genocide Convention.\nOn 28 March 2024, after a renewed application from South Africa, the Court once again indicated provisional measures, this time aimed at the prevention of famine and starvation, as well as access to basic services, humanitarian assistance, and medical care.\nThen, on 24 May 2024, after a further application,\nthe Court ordered Israel\nto “\nimmediately half its military offensive, and any other action in the Rafah Governorate, which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part\n”. The proceedings are ongoing.\nAlleged Breaches of Certain International Obligations in respect of the Occupied Palestinian Territory (Nicaragua v. Germany)\nalso relates to the conflict in Gaza. In contrast with South Africa’s case, however, Nicaragua’s application relates not to Israel, but to Germany, on the basis of the latter’s support for Israel. And, in contrast with both the Ukrainian and South African applications, Nicaragua was not successful in its request for the indication of provisional measures.\nThe analysis in the Court’s order of 30 April 2024, refusing the request, is notable for its brevity in contrast with the orders in\nSouth Africa v. Israel\n. It is less methodical and largely consists of an account of the facts as alleged by both Parties. Despite the short shrift given to the request (described elsewhere as a “\npragmatic\n” approach) the Court also refused Germany’s request to delist the case entirely. As a result proceedings, too, are ongoing.\nSudan’s Application to the Court\nSudan has now added another conflict to the first two – its struggle against the RSF in West Sudan. Sudan’s application, entitled\nProceedings Instituted by Sudan against the United Arab Emirates\n, relates to the activities of the RSF, and the UAE’s alleged support for the organisation and related militias. The conflict in Sudan, and the impact on the Masalit people in particular, has already attracted\nattention at the United Nations\n.\nSudan claims that the UAE has violated its obligations under Article I of the Genocide Convention (an obligation to prevent and to punish genocide). It alleges that the UAE is “\ncomplicit in the genocide on the Masalit\n” by direction of and provision of “\nextensive financial, political, and military support\n” for the RSF.\nAs with the three cases already before the Court, in relation to Ukraine and Gaza, the ultimate resolution of Sudan’s application will take years. In the interim, however, the request for provisional measures will, once against, bring the Genocide Convention before the Court.\nRequest for Provisional Measures\nIn addition to the final relief, Sudan has also requested, pursuant to Article 41 of the\nICJ Statute\nthe indication of provisional measures. This approach follows a recent trend – both in the cases brought pursuant to the Genocide Convention (set out above) as well as more generally – whereby applications to the Court have been accompanied with robust, even ambitious, requests for provisional measures.\nIn Sudan’s case, the\nrequest\nis for the Court to order the UAE to take “\nall measures within its power\n” to prevent the commission of acts contrary to Article II of the Genocide Conventions, as well as to order the UAE to ensure that any “\nirregular armed units\n” which it directs or supports (and related persons and organisations) do not commit any acts contrary to Article II, or any related acts.\nIn some respects, a request for the indication of provisional measures may be more impactful than the ultimate determination of the case. The threshold for the indication of provisional measures is necessarily lower than that which applies when the case comes for final determination before the Court.\nMoreover, provisional measures raise the prospect of the Court having an immediate impact on an ongoing situation, rather than an after the fact determination of the lawfulness of things already done.\nAs former ICJ President, Judge Joan Donoghue,\nhas said\n, once the Court delivers a final judgment, it is not a “monitoring mechanism”. In contrast, in\nSouth Africa v. Israel\n, the Court has required Israel to report on its compliance with provisional measures, and Israel has done so.\nIn Sudan’s case, it will be of interest to see which of the two approaches relied upon more recently prevails: the more methodical approach of\nSouth Africa v. Israel\n, or the more cursory – “pragmatic” – approach in\nNicaragua v. Germany\n. And, if the Court does indicate provisional measures, the actual impact of those measures on the ground will give a further indication of the Court’s influence.\nLaw’s Potency and Limitations\nSudan’s application, then, is a reminder of the potency of, and limitations of, both procedural and substantive law in the face of conflicts which have devastating daily impacts on the lives of millions.\nIn terms of procedure, part of the potency of a request for the indication of provisional measures is that, in accordance with Article 74 of the Rules of the Court, such a request “\nshall have priority over all other cases\n”. The procedure therefore offers States an opportunity to achieve a timely intervention in an ongoing situation. After careful consideration in South Africa’s case, the reasoning in Nicaragua’s was more conclusory, and it remains to be seen if this marks a sea-change or not.\nIn terms of substantive law, it is notable that Ukraine, South Africa, Nicaragua, and Sudan, have all relied on the Genocide Convention. The Convention is a potent tool, both because of the moral force of a claim that acts of genocide are being carried out, and – relatedly – because of the legal force which those claims have had, in particular since the decision in\nApplication of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (The Gambia v. Myanmar\n)\n.\nHowever, not all disputes are capable of characterisation as falling within the nexus of the Genocide Convention. In the future, a\ntreaty on crimes against humanity\nmay provide a jurisdictional basis to bring a conflict before the Court, resort to the morally, legally, and politically difficult concept of genocide. (See also on this\nthe comments of Judge Donoghue\n). That treaty, though, remains some way off.\nIn the interim, however slow the wheels may turn, the Genocide Convention is likely to remain grist to the mill of international justice. No adjudicative body, or indeed international organisation of any kind, has proven capable of preventing all conflict. Still, in the face of diplomatic malaise, the ICJ’s authority as an independent judicial organ makes it an ever more valuable forum for a rules-based international order.\nTags\ninternational law\n,\nhuman rights\nGet in touch\nCian Murphy\nBarrister\nGet in touch\nCian Murphy\nBarrister\nLatest Insights\n3/10/2025 11:51:40 AM\nHow does an assured shorthold tenancy become a secure tenancy?

Sudan has requested that, pending final judgment, the ICJ indicate provisional measures.\nBoth the application itself, and the request for provisional measures, provide the most recent example of States invoking the Genocide Convention and requiring the World Court to adjudicate on active conflicts across the globe.\nThree Conflicts in Recent Years\nThe conflict in Sudan is the third in recent years to give rise to a dispute before the ICJ which relies on the Genocide Convention dispute.\nFirst, in\nAllegations of Genocide Under the Convention on Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Ukraine v. Russian Federation)\n,\nUkraine asserted that the basis upon which Russia justified its 2022 invasion gave rise to a dispute under the Convention.\nOn\n16 March 2022 the ICJ made an order\nto indicate provisional measures, including (by 13 votes to 2), to require the Russian Federation to “\nimmediately suspend the military operations that it commenced on 24 February 2022 in the territory of Ukraine\n”.\nThe order also, by unanimity, required both Ukraine and the Russian Federation, to “\nrefrain from any action which might aggravate or extend the dispute before the Court or make it more difficult to resolve\n”. The proceedings remain ongoing, and as of early 2025 the Court is seized with the question as to\nwhether or not certain counter-claims made by the Russian Federation are admissible\n.\nSecond, in\nApplication of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide in the Gaza Strip (South Africa v. Israel)\n, the Court initially indicated interim measures on 26 January 2024. In a carefully reasoned Order, it concluded that it has\nprima facie\njurisdiction (jurisdiction “on the face of it”) over the dispute, and that South Africa has\nprima facie\nstanding to bring the claim.\nIn one of the more misunderstood aspects of the analysis, the Court also concluded that at least some of the rights asserted by South Africa are plausible (i.e. the right of Palestinians in Gaza to be protected from acts of genocide and related prohibited acts), and that there was a link between those plausible rights and the provisional measures sought. As a result the ICJ indicated certain measures which, in effect, require Israel to comply with the Genocide Convention.\nOn 28 March 2024, after a renewed application from South Africa, the Court once again indicated provisional measures, this time aimed at the prevention of famine and starvation, as well as access to basic services, humanitarian assistance, and medical care.\nThen, on 24 May 2024, after a further application,\nthe Court ordered Israel\nto “\nimmediately half its military offensive, and any other action in the Rafah Governorate, which may inflict on the Palestinian group in Gaza conditions of life that could bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part\n”. The proceedings are ongoing.\nAlleged Breaches of Certain International Obligations in respect of the Occupied Palestinian Territory (Nicaragua v. Germany)\nalso relates to the conflict in Gaza. In contrast with South Africa’s case, however, Nicaragua’s application relates not to Israel, but to Germany, on the basis of the latter’s support for Israel. And, in contrast with both the Ukrainian and South African applications, Nicaragua was not successful in its request for the indication of provisional measures.\nThe analysis in the Court’s order of 30 April 2024, refusing the request, is notable for its brevity in contrast with the orders in\nSouth Africa v. Israel\n. It is less methodical and largely consists of an account of the facts as alleged by both Parties. Despite the short shrift given to the request (described elsewhere as a “\npragmatic\n” approach) the Court also refused Germany’s request to delist the case entirely. As a result proceedings, too, are ongoing.\nSudan’s Application to the Court\nSudan has now added another conflict to the first two – its struggle against the RSF in West Sudan.

In this case, Sudan alleges that the UAE is complicit in genocidal acts committed against the Masalit group in the Darfur region of Sudan from at least 2023 by the Rapid Support Forces and their allied militias. Sudan further contends that the UAE is providing direct support to the forces and their allies, enabling them to perpetrate what is often referred to as the ‘crime of crimes’ — genocide.\nSudan’s accusation of genocide against the Rapid Support Forces and the Emirates’ involvement is far from a shocking revelation. Rather, it merely brings to light what has long been discussed in diplomatic circles. Sudan has already made several statements at the United Nations General Assembly and the UN Security Council targeting the Emirates’ involvement with the Rapid Support Forces. Earlier this year, the United States government accused the organisation of committing genocide and imposed sanctions on several Emirates-based shell companies linked to the organisation, as well as on its leader Mohamad Hamdan Dagalo. On January 27, 2025, International Criminal Court prosecutor Karim Khan made a statement before the UN Security Council that his office is seeking arrest warrants for individuals accused of atrocities in the Darfur region.\nThroughout the history of the International Court of Justice, the Genocide Convention has frequently served as the jurisdictional basis for cases. The Sudan v UAE case marks the 19th genocide-related case and is the 5th ongoing genocide-related case. This is largely due to Article IX of the Genocide Convention, which empowers the ICJ to adjudicate disputes related to the interpretation, application, or fulfillment of the convention. Sudan acceded to the Genocide Convention on October 13, 2003, while the UAE did so on November 11, 2003. However, the UAE’s accession included a reservation to Article IX, requiring its consent for any genocide-related dispute to be submitted to the ICJ. Notably, Bangladesh also made a similar reservation to the Genocide Convention.\nIn the decentralised international legal order, the ICJ does not possess automatic jurisdiction over any case. This means disputing states must establish an uncontested jurisdictional basis for their cases. In many instances, the court bifurcates proceedings to address issues related to jurisdiction and admissibility as part of incidental proceedings. If the court finds that the case lacks a jurisdictional basis at the preliminary objections judgment, it will not proceed to the merits of that case, regardless of the strength of the evidence presented.\nIn Sudan v UAE, the UAE’s reservation to Article IX of the Genocide Convention presents a nearly insurmountable hurdle to proceeding to the merits stage. This issue warrants a thorough analysis.\nAmong the 18 prior Genocide Convention cases, four have involved the issue of reservations to Article IX. In the Pakistani Prisoners of War case (1973) between Pakistan and India, concerning the trials of Pakistani prisoners of war for their alleged roles in crimes committed in Bangladesh, India’s reservation to the Genocide Convention could have led to an unfavourable outcome for Pakistan. However, the dispute was resolved through diplomatic negotiations, and the case was discontinued. In two out of the ten Use of Force cases (1999), involving Yugoslavia on the one hand and Spain and the United States on the other, the cases were removed from the ICJ’s docket after the Provisional Measures Order due to Article IX reservations.\nIn the Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo case (2002) between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, the Court declined to order provisional measures due to Rwanda’s reservation to Article IX, among other factors, but did not remove the case from the list. Ultimately, the court ruled in its preliminary objection judgement that there was no jurisdictional basis for the case. While the court affirmed the jus cogens nature of the prohibition of genocide, it also stated that this does not override the requirement for jurisdiction.\nIn its application instituting proceedings, Sudan argues that the reservation to Article IX does not prevent it from submitting the dispute to the ICJ, citing the ICJ’s advisory opinion on preservations to the genocide convention (1951). However, ICJ, in the same advisory opinion, held that a reservation to Article IX is valid as long as it does not defeat the object and purpose of the convention. This principle was later codified in Article 19(c) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (1969). Sudan must now persuade the court to depart from this established legal position. While the ICJ is not strictly bound by precedent, it generally adheres to its prior rulings unless there is a compelling reason to deviate. It remains to be seen how Sudan will present its interpretation of the reservation to the Court.\nEven if the ICJ were to rule that the reservation to Article IX is invalid — an unlikely scenario — this would not automatically allow Sudan to proceed with its case against the UAE. The reservation is linked to a state’s consent to become a party to a multilateral treaty, raising the question of whether the reservation can be severed from the consent. The European Court of Human Rights has developed the doctrine of severability to address similar issues in cases such as Bellilos v Switzerland and Loizidou v Turkey. However, its applicability to the ICJ remains shrouded in uncertainty.\nFurthermore, Sudan alleges that the Rapid Support Forces is committing genocide with direct support from the UAE. Thus, Sudan must establish the link between the RSF and the UAE within the framework of international law. The International Court of Justice has addressed this issue in two key cases: Nicaragua v USA (1986) and Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro (2007). In Nicaragua v USA, the court established the ‘effective control test’ as the threshold for determining a state’s responsibility for the conducts of a non-state armed group in violating international law. Subsequently, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia held in Prosecutor v Tadić (1995) that the appropriate threshold was the ‘overall control test.’ However, the ICJ reaffirmed the ‘effective control test’ in Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro.\nThe evidentiary threshold for the ‘effective control test’ is higher than that for the ‘overall control test.’ In both prior cases, the applicant states failed to meet the ‘effective control test’ standard to establish their allegations. Sudan is likely to face similar challenges in proving this link, both during the provisional measures hearing and, if applicable, in the merit proceedings. It now appears that Sudan must overcome three labours of Hercules to advance to the merits stage.\nSudan has also requested provisional measures in this case. The International Court of Justice is expected to announce hearing dates soon. The outcome of the case will largely depend on the court’s decision regarding provisional measures. Generally, the jurisdictional threshold — prima facie jurisdiction, and evidentiary standard — plausibility of right, for provisional measures are lower than those required at the merits stage, making it relatively easier to establish the requirements for such measures. However, failure to establish jurisdiction could lead to the case being removed from the list, as seen in the use of force cases. The question remains whether Sudan will succeed in maintaining the case or if the UAE will prevail in arguing for its dismissal.\nBeyond these legal complexities, the ICJ proceedings carry the potential for profound political ramifications. Sudan has brought the Darfur issue before the international community, and it is expected to present additional evidence supporting its claims during the provisional measures hearing. It is entirely possible that Sudan is pursuing political objectives rather than legal remedies through what some might term ‘lawfare.’ Such an approach is not novel in contemporary international relations, where legal disputes are sometimes leveraged for political gain.\nQuazi Omar Foysal is an international law expert.\nTags\nQuazi Omar Foysal\nSudan\ngenocide case\nUnited Arab Emirates\nInternational Court of Justice\nGenocide Convention\nRead More\nEx-home ministry PRO confined, taken into custody\nMar 21, 2025\nRooppur nuclear plant runs hydraulic pressure tests\nMar 21, 2025\nNOAB urged to announce 5-day Eid vacation\nMar 21, 2025\n- Advertisement -\nRecent News\nEx-home ministry PRO confined, taken into custody\nRooppur nuclear plant runs hydraulic pressure tests\nNOAB urged to announce 5-day Eid vacation\nAbducted Thakurgaon student found dead, 2 arrested\nIsraeli warns residents of south Gaza town to evacuate ahead of strike\nm\nEditor: Nurul Kabir, Published by the Chairman, Editorial Board ASM Shahidullah Khan on behalf of Media New Age Ltd.\nHamid Plaza (4th floor), 300/5/A/1, Bir Uttam CR Datta Road, Hatirpool, Dhaka-1205\nPABX: +8802 41062247-50, Fax: +8802-41062245\n+8802-9632245-48\n[email protected]\nFor Advertisement, Cell: +8801849 263831\nEmail:\n[email protected]\nAbout\nContact\nArchive\nDisclaimer & Privacy Policy\nAdvertisement\nTerms & Conditions\nSitemap\nAbout\nContact\nTerms & Condition\nPrivacy\nCopyright © New Age - Media New Age Limited or its affiliated companies.

In this case, Sudan alleges that the UAE is complicit in genocidal acts committed against the Masalit group in the Darfur region of Sudan from at least 2023 by the Rapid Support Forces and their allied militias. Sudan further contends that the UAE is providing direct support to the forces and their allies, enabling them to perpetrate what is often referred to as the ‘crime of crimes’ — genocide.\nSudan’s accusation of genocide against the Rapid Support Forces and the Emirates’ involvement is far from a shocking revelation. Rather, it merely brings to light what has long been discussed in diplomatic circles. Sudan has already made several statements at the United Nations General Assembly and the UN Security Council targeting the Emirates’ involvement with the Rapid Support Forces. Earlier this year, the United States government accused the organisation of committing genocide and imposed sanctions on several Emirates-based shell companies linked to the organisation, as well as on its leader Mohamad Hamdan Dagalo. On January 27, 2025, International Criminal Court prosecutor Karim Khan made a statement before the UN Security Council that his office is seeking arrest warrants for individuals accused of atrocities in the Darfur region.\nThroughout the history of the International Court of Justice, the Genocide Convention has frequently served as the jurisdictional basis for cases. The Sudan v UAE case marks the 19th genocide-related case and is the 5th ongoing genocide-related case. This is largely due to Article IX of the Genocide Convention, which empowers the ICJ to adjudicate disputes related to the interpretation, application, or fulfillment of the convention. Sudan acceded to the Genocide Convention on October 13, 2003, while the UAE did so on November 11, 2003. However, the UAE’s accession included a reservation to Article IX, requiring its consent for any genocide-related dispute to be submitted to the ICJ. Notably, Bangladesh also made a similar reservation to the Genocide Convention.\nIn the decentralised international legal order, the ICJ does not possess automatic jurisdiction over any case. This means disputing states must establish an uncontested jurisdictional basis for their cases. In many instances, the court bifurcates proceedings to address issues related to jurisdiction and admissibility as part of incidental proceedings. If the court finds that the case lacks a jurisdictional basis at the preliminary objections judgment, it will not proceed to the merits of that case, regardless of the strength of the evidence presented.\nIn Sudan v UAE, the UAE’s reservation to Article IX of the Genocide Convention presents a nearly insurmountable hurdle to proceeding to the merits stage. This issue warrants a thorough analysis.\nAmong the 18 prior Genocide Convention cases, four have involved the issue of reservations to Article IX. In the Pakistani Prisoners of War case (1973) between Pakistan and India, concerning the trials of Pakistani prisoners of war for their alleged roles in crimes committed in Bangladesh, India’s reservation to the Genocide Convention could have led to an unfavourable outcome for Pakistan.

The conflict has displaced more than 10 million people, and left over 12 million\nfacing high levels of acute food insecurity\n.\nMiddle East Eye has\nreported\non the network of supply lines that exist to funnel arms and other goods from the UAE to the RSF, via allied groups and governments in Libya, Chad and the Central African Republic. The UAE denies providing support to the RSF.\nBoth Sudan and the UAE are parties to the Genocide Convention.\nKhartoum requested that the World Court implements a number of provisional measures, including ordering the UAE to take measures to prevent: the killing and causing serious harm towards the Masalit, deliberately inflicting conditions to bring about the physical destruction of the group, and the imposition of measures that are intended to prevent births within the group.\nIt also called for provisional measures ordering the UAE to ensure that any armed units supported by it do not directly or publicly incite to commit genocide.\nDoubts on jurisdiction\nEmirati Foreign Minister Anwar Gargash commented on the case saying the Sudanese army was pursuing “feeble media maneuvers to justify their rejection of peace and the political path”.\nMeanwhile, a UAE official told Reuters on Thursday that Abu Dhabi would be seeking the immediate dismissal of the case, stating that the allegations \"lack any legal or factual basis\".\nSudan: Genocide 'against non-Arab groups' taking place in Darfur\nRead More »\nThe unnamed official described the application as \"nothing more than a cynical publicity stunt aimed at diverting attention from the established complicity of the Sudanese armed forces in the widespread atrocities that continue to devastate Sudan and its people\".\nAlthough the UAE is a party to the Genocide Convention, on which the case is based, it made a reservtion to Article Nine of the treaty when it acceded to it in 2005, which will likely lead the court to dismiss the case, said Michael Becker, assistant professor of international human rights law at Trinity College Dublin.\nArticle Nine of the convention allows dispute settlement before the ICJ when a state party violates the treaty. States are allowed to opt out of the provision in advance of signing the treaty.\nBy making a reservation to the article, the UAE withheld its consent to this provision, said Becker. Many other states have opted out of this clause, including the US, China, Algeria, Bahrain, Morocco, Malaysia, Yemen and India.\nInternational law allows states to express reservations on treaty provisions, if such reservations do not contradict the object and purpose of the treaty.\n'It strikes me as highly unlikely that Sudan will be able to persuade the ICJ to make a U-turn on this issue'\n- Mike Becker, international law expert\n\"Sudan will likely argue that opting out of ICJ jurisdiction runs contrary to the object and purpose of the Genocide Convention,\" Becker told Middle East Eye. \"This argument is almost certain to fail.\"\nThe ICJ previously ruled in a case between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda in 2006 that reservations to Article Nine do not contradict the object and purpose of the convention.\n\"The court’s rationale turned on the fact that such a reservation does not affect a party’s substantive obligations under the treaty but only excludes one method of settling a dispute relating to those obligations,\" explained Becker.\n\"It strikes me as highly unlikely that Sudan will be able to persuade the ICJ to make a U-turn on this issue, notwithstanding the important legal issues raised by Sudan’s claims against the UAE.\"\nIn response to Becker's online comments to that effect, Sudanese UN envoy Ammar Mahmoud said the above arguments have been \"duly considered\" by the Sudanese government.\n\"Indeed, the submission explicitly addressed this issue, asserting that such a reservation carries no legal weight, as the UAE’s actions fundamentally contradict and undermine the core principles of the Genocide Convention - a position affirmed by the International Court of Justice as early as 1951,\" Mahmoud wrote on\nX\n, referring to the court's landmark\nadvisory opinion\nof 1951, although it ruled that reservations to the Genocide Convention are not prohibited.\nMiddle East Eye delivers independent and unrivalled coverage and analysis of the Middle East, North Africa and beyond.

    "cleaned_text_content": "UK enrages Sudanese army government by inviting UAE to London conference\n\nSudan's army-aligned government tells MEE that presence of Rapid Support Forces patron will 'render the conference little more than a public relations stunt'\n\nBy\nOscar Rickett\nin London\nPublished date:\n14 March 2025 17:30 GMT\n\n\nThe UK has invited its ally the United Arab Emirates to a London conference on Sudan's war in April, but not the Sudanese army-aligned government, according to a document shared with Middle East Eye on Friday.\n\nNeither the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) nor its enemy, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), have been invited to the conference, set to take place in the British capital on 15 April.\n\nThe presence of the UAE, which has supplied the RSF with weapons and other goods throughout a war that began in April 2023 and has led to the world’s largest humanitarian crisis, at the talks has prompted outrage from Sudanese officials aligned to the army.\n\nIn a document shared with MEE, the Sudanese foreign ministry said that it had not been invited to the conference under the pretext of being a “warring party”.\n\n“Ironically, the UAE, effectively a party to the war, is invited,” the document, dated 14 March, states.\n\nThe concept paper for the London conference identifies participants as “states and international organisations focused on and invested in supporting a peaceful way forward for the Sudanese”.\n\nThis has drawn the ire of Sudan’s army aligned government, which states: “The participation of the UAE will only render the conference a little more than a public relations stunt and to whitewash its image as it is being pursued for genocide at the International Court of Justice (ICJ).”\n\nA spokesperson for the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said:\n\n“The Foreign Secretary will convene Foreign Ministers at the London Sudan Conference to galvanise international efforts to bring an end to the conflict and get aid to where it is needed the most.”\n\n“Attendees will include regional countries, major donors, and multilateral organisations.”\n\nMEE understands that representatives of Qatar, Egypt, Turkey and Saudi Arabia will all be at the conference. All four are known to favour the Sudanese army over the RSF.\n\nThe UAE and the RSF\n\nLast week, Sudan filed an application to open proceedings before the ICJ against the UAE over alleged complicity in acts of genocide against the Masalit community.\n\nAnwar Gargash, the UAE’s foreign minister, responded by posing on social media that “Sudan’s priority should be to cease fire in this absurd and destructive war and address the massive humanitarian catastrophe.” He lambasted the Sudanese army for pursuing “feeble media manoeuvres to justify their rejection of peace and the political path”.\n\nThe US government has determined that “members of the RSF and allied militias have committed genocide in Sudan”. This has primarily targeted the Black African Masalit group in Darfur, western Sudan.\n\n'The UAE needs to be a part of any process. But so do all the main actors. But to include the UAE and exclude the Sudanese misses the bigger picture'\n- Cameron Hudson, former US official\n\nMiddle East Eye has reported previously on the UAE’s support for the RSF, which comes through networks in Libya, Chad, the Central African Republic, Uganda and other parts of the Horn of Africa.\n\nRenewed attention and the activity of plane tracking accounts has meant that the supply lines have shifted recently, according to multiple sources MEE has spoken to in the last month.\n\nRecently released foreign trade data from 2024 shows that the UAE is the biggest buyer of Sudanese products. Other than army general Yasser al-Atta, no Sudanese official has publicly called for the severing of diplomatic ties with Abu Dhabi.\n\nThe UAE has always publicly denied arming the RSF. But on 18 December, Brett McGurk, a senior official in the outgoing administration of US President Joe Biden, wrote to Senator Chris Van Hollen that the UAE had assured the US government it was no longer “transferring any weapons” to the RSF.\n\nMcGurk’s announcement served as a tacit admission that the UAE had, in fact, been supplying the RSF along.\n\nOn 24 January, Van Hollen and fellow Democrat Sara Jacobs announced that “based on a Biden Administration briefing and as also demonstrated by recent reporting”, they could confirm that the UAE “is providing weapons to the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan, in direct contradiction to the assurances it has made to the United States.”\n\nLondon calling\n\nNews that the UK had invited the UAE but not the Sudanese army-aligned government, now based in Port Sudan, to its conference came as a nasty surprise to Sudanese diplomats, who believed relations with the British government were warming.\n\nLast week, UK Foreign Minister David Lammy, who has said that “we must not forget Sudan” while previously dodging questions in parliament about Emirati involvement in the war, sent Harriet Mathews, director general for Africa, the Americas and overseas territories, to Port Sudan to meet with members of the Sudanese government based there.\n\nMathews expressed her “deep concern” at “RSF-supporting parallel governments”, referring to the one recently announced in Nairobi by Abdul Rahim Dagalo, deputy leader of the RSF and brother of its chief, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who is better known as Hemeti.\n\nThis meeting, and other contact between Sudanese and British officials, had encouraged the Port Sudan government to believe that the UK was no longer treating the army and the RSF as equally culpable for the war.\n\n\nBut following its exclusion from the London conference in April and the inclusion of the UAE, the army-aligned government said that the UK needed to “reassess its position, acknowledging the RSF’s existential threat” to Sudan.\n\n“The UAE involvement must similarly be identified as the single most important factor prolonging the war,” the Sudanese army-aligned document shared with MEE stated.\n\nKholood Khair, a Sudanese analyst and founder of the Confluence Advisory think tank, told MEE that Mathews' trip to Port Sudan \"had seemed in part intended to allay concerns that SAF would have around the UK's intentions for this conference\".\n\n\"But clearly they didn't discuss the role of the UAE - or perhaps they didn't arrive at an agreement about the inclusion of the UAE. From the UK's perspective, not inviting the UAE doesn't make sense... and they've invited a lot of SAF-aligned states as well.\"\n\nWhether the London conference advances a diplomatic process that has gone nowhere during the almost two years of war that have passed is another matter.\n\n“It’s all performative,” Cameron Hudson, a former CIA analyst and State Department official said of the upcoming UK-organised event. “If they were interested in ending the war they would be searching for practical solutions nor barring the parties from talks,” he told MEE.\n\n“The UAE needs to be a part of any process. But so do all the main actors. But to include the UAE and exclude the Sudanese misses the bigger picture.\"\n",

Famine has been declared in parts of the country and is likely to spread.\nSudan called on the ICJ, which rules in disputes between countries, to issue emergency orders -- \"provisional measures\" in the court jargon -- to force the UAE to pay reparations, among other requests.\n\"The United Arab Emirates must make full reparation for the injury caused [by] its internationally wrongful acts, including paying reimbursement to the victims of the war,\" Sudan's submission argued.\nICJ rulings are legally binding but the court has no power to enforce them.\nFor example, it ordered Russia to halt its assault on Ukraine only a few weeks after the invasion -- to no avail.\nBut Khartoum urged the court to act quickly \"to ensure the urgent and fullest possible protection for the Sudanese civilian people who remain at grave and immediate risk of continuing and further acts of genocide.\"\n'Ludicrous'\nSudan's submission accused the RSF of \"genocide, murder, theft of property, rape, forcible displacement, trespassing, vandalism of public properties, and violations of human rights.\"\nIt added that these acts were \"perpetrated and enabled by the direct support given to the rebel RSF militia and related militia groups by the United Arab Emirates.\"\nSudan charged that the UAE was breaching its obligations under the 1948 UN Genocide Convention \"by attempting to commit genocide, conspiring to commit genocide, inciting genocide, complicity in genocide, and failing to prevent and punish genocide.\"\n\"The allegations presented by the SAF representative at the ICJ lack any legal or factual basis, representing yet another attempt to distract from this calamitous war,\" the UAE official said.\nIn June, Sudan's UN ambassador Al-Harith Idriss al-Harith accused the UAE of fomenting conflict in his country, saying the RSF was being \"supported with weapons by the Emirates\".\nThe Emirati envoy to the United Nations, Mohamed Issa Hamad Mohamed Abushahab, rejected the claims as \"ludicrous\" and accused Sudan of using the council to plead the army's case.\nUN experts monitoring an arms embargo on Darfur said accusations that the UAE had funnelled weapons to the RSF through Chad were \"credible\".\nThe Gulf state promised the United States in December that it would not arm the RSF, after two US lawmakers attempted to block its purchase of $1.2 billion in advanced rockets and long-range missiles.\nIn January, the US lawmakers said the UAE had broken its promises and was still supplying the Sudanese rebels.\n(AFP)\nIsrael strikes Lebanon amid ceasefire, kills scores in Gaza\nRead More\nIran to weigh 'opportunities' and threats in Trump letter\nRead More\nIsrael snatches Netzarim Corridor as Katz threatens displacement\nRead More\nIsrael begins ground operations, issues 'last warning' to Gaza\nRead More\nProsecutor says Iran put bounty on head of Masih Alinejad\nRead More\nFollow the Middle East's top stories in English at The New Arab on Google News\nTags\nSudan\nSudan war\nUAE\nRapid Support Forces\nInternational Court of Justice\nMore In News\nThe New Arab Staff & Agencies\nBenjamin Netanyahu\nMENA\nLive Story\nNetanyahu blasts Israel's 'Deep State' in Tik Tok video\nThe New Arab Staff\nIsrael\nWorld\nLive Story\nNetanyahu gifts US Senator pager to celebrate Lebanon operation\nThe New Arab Staff\nPost-Assad Syria\nMENA\nLive Story\nSyria arrests Assad commander accused of war crimes, robberies\nFooter Menu List\nShow — Footer Menu List\nHide — Footer Menu List\nNews\nAnalysis\nOpinion\nFeatures\nInvestigations\nPodcast\nVideo\nGet The New Arab’s newsletters straight to your inbox\nSign up\nSocial Menu\nShow — Social Menu\nHide — Social Menu\nInstagram\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYoutube\nRSS\nSocial Menu\nShow — Social Menu\nHide — Social Menu\nInstagram\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYoutube\nRSS\n© 2025 The New Arab\nFooter Static Menu\nShow — Footer Static Menu\nHide — Footer Static Menu\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nAdvertise With Us\nEditorial team\nCareers\nEthics Policy\nCorrections Policy\nOther Policies and Standards\nNewsletters\n© 2025 The New Arab\nFooter Bottom\nShow — Footer Bottom\nHide — Footer Bottom\nPrivacy Policy\nTerms of Use\nSitemap\nWe use our own third-party cookies to study and analyze the use of the website and to improve our services and functionalities.\r\n\r\nBy continuing to browse our site, you agree to the use of cookies and our\nPrivacy Policy\n.\nAccept",

The Court should act quickly—and not confine itself to the specific demands made by the Sudanese military leader General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan.\nThe United Nations-recognized\nGovernment of Sudan (GoS) has instituted proceedings\nagainst the United Arab Emirates in the International Court of Justice. The basis of the claim is that the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have committed genocide against the Masalit people of West Darfur, and that the UAE is ‘is complicit in the genocide on the Masalit through its direction of and provision of extensive financial, political, and military support for the rebel RSF militia.’ The GoS is demanding that the Court order\nimmediate provisional measures\nfor the UAE to fulfil its commitments to prevent acts of genocide.\nThe evidence for genocidal acts by the RSF, against the Masalit and other communities elsewhere in Sudan, is strong.\nHuman Rights Watch\nhas spoken of ‘ethnic cleansing.’\nThe United States\nhas issued a genocide determination. The Special Advisor to the UN Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide,\nAlice Wairimu Nderitu has raised the alarm\nof similar crimes elsewhere in Darfur. The strongest case is made by the self-incriminating ‘\ntrophy’ videos taken and circulated by RSF members\nof their own atrocities.\nIt’s possible that the International Criminal Court (ICC), which has a mandate for Darfur dating back twenty years, may issue arrest warrants against RSF leaders for genocide, including its leader, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagolo, known as ‘Hemedti’. But unlike the ICC, which prosecutes individuals for international crimes, the ICJ deals with states only. This means that al-Burhan, cannot bring the RSF as a political-military organization to court. Instead he has turned to its sponsor.\nThe evidence for the\nUAE support to the RSF\nis strong, including weapons smuggled under the\ncover of humanitarian flights\n, while\nUAE denials have not convinced\nUS lawmakers.\nThe ICJ should hear the case promptly and issue provisional orders.\nThe judges at the ICJ should also go beyond the specific orders requested by the GoS, in three respects.\nFirst, the Court should also order the UAE to do its utmost to ensure that the RSF does not commit genocide by starvation. Article 2(c) of\nthe Genocide Convention\nprohibits ‘Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.’ The RSF siege of al-Fashir and the nearby camps for internally displaced persons, and attacks on essential health facilities, have been causing\nmass starvation there\nfor a year. Many people in the city and the IDP camps are from the Zaghawa ethnic group and there is good reason to believe that the RSF may be targeting them on the basis of that identity. The Court should not wait for proof that the RSF is committing genocide by starvation. It should also order the UAE to do all in its power to provide humanitarian assistance and essential services to the besieged population, both directly and through pressing the RSF to permit such assistance.\nAl-Burhan’s foreign ministry has denied that famine is happening in Sudan and\nexpelled the UN’s Integrated food security Phase Classification\n(IPC) for determining that it is. The Court should assess the facts, including the IPC’s objective and impartial assessment.\nSecond, Sudan is itself bound by the Genocide Convention. The Court is required to hold the GoS to the same standards. The Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) and allied militia have committed\nethnically-targeted massacres\n, for example in Gezira state, and there are\nfears of reprisals against civilians and relief workers\nin areas that the army captures from the RSF. The GoS has been restricting humanitarian aid to areas under RSF control, using starvation as a weapon. The provisional order for humanitarian aid should be equally binding on the GoS to prevent and punish genocide.\nOver the decades, SAF has a history of violations, including\nnumerous causes plausibly described as genocide\n, in southern Sudan, the Nuba Mountains, and Darfur. This history is extremely salient to the current case, the most aspects of that pattern of crimes over the decades are reproduced in today’s violations. This was a point I emphasized in\nmy testimony to the ICC\n, at the start of the trial of Ali Abdel Rahman ‘Kushayb’, in 2022. (The judges’ decision is expected soon.)\nThird, the Court should order the GoS and the UAE, and through the UAE, the RSF, to take action to prevent starvation whether or not it is directly related to the commission of genocide. The judges cannot in good conscience address a case in which the war crime of starvation is being perpetrated, and ignore those crimes, simply because they are considering a claim of genocide.\nHere’s some proposed language for humanitarian action:\n“Take all necessary and effective measures to ensure, without delay, in full co-operation with the United Nations, the unhindered provision at scale by all concerned of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance, including food, water, electricity, fuel, shelter, clothing, hygiene and sanitation requirements, as well as medical supplies and medical care to all Sudanese, including by increasing the capacity and number of border crossing points and maintaining them open for as long as necessary.”\nAs mentioned, there’s a key shortcoming in any ICJ proceedings. The RSF is not a party to the ICJ. The RSF administration, called by its adversaries the ‘Republic of Kadamol’, is not a recognized state. It is not represented in the Court and the ICJ cannot directly give orders to the RSF. But the RSF aspires to government. If it is to have any political credibility, it should begin by enforcing the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide.\nThe ICJ can affirm the laws and principles to which all are bound, and in addressing its orders to the UAE, indicate unequivocally what the RSF needs to do.\nShare\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nBlueSky\nAuthor\nAlex de Waal\nis a Research Professor at The Fletcher School, Tufts University, and leads the WPF research programs on African Peacemaking and Mass Starvation.\nConsidered one of the foremost experts on the Horn of Africa, his scholarly work and practice has also probed humanitarian crisis and response, human rights, pandemic disease, and conflict and peace-building. His latest book is\nNew Pandemics, Old Politics: Two Hundred Years of War on Disease and its Alternatives.\nHe is also author of\nMass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine\nand\nThe Real Politics of the Horn of Africa\n(Polity Press, 2015)\nFollowing a fellowship with the Global Equity Initiative at Harvard (2004-06), he worked with the Social Science Research Council as Director of the program on HIV/AIDS and Social Transformation, and led projects on conflict and humanitarian crises in Africa (2006-09).

The basis of the claim is that the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have committed genocide against the Masalit people of West Darfur, and that the UAE is ‘is complicit in the genocide on the Masalit through its direction of and provision of extensive financial, political, and military support for the rebel RSF militia.’ The GoS is demanding that the Court order immediate provisional measures for the UAE to fulfil its commitments to prevent acts of genocide.\n\nThe evidence for genocidal acts by the RSF, against the Masalit and other communities elsewhere in Sudan, is strong. Human Rights Watch has spoken of ‘ethnic cleansing.’ The United States has issued a genocide determination. The Special Advisor to the UN Secretary-General on the Prevention of Genocide, Alice Wairimu Nderitu has raised the alarm of similar crimes elsewhere in Darfur. The strongest case is made by the self-incriminating ‘trophy’ videos taken and circulated by RSF members of their own atrocities.\n\nIt’s possible that the International Criminal Court (ICC), which has a mandate for Darfur dating back twenty years, may issue arrest warrants against RSF leaders for genocide, including its leader, General Mohamed Hamdan Dagolo, known as ‘Hemedti’. But unlike the ICC, which prosecutes individuals for international crimes, the ICJ deals with states only. This means that al-Burhan, cannot bring the RSF as a political-military organization to court. Instead he has turned to its sponsor.\n\nThe evidence for the UAE support to the RSF is strong, including weapons smuggled under the cover of humanitarian flights, while UAE denials have not convinced US lawmakers.\n\nThe ICJ should hear the case promptly and issue provisional orders.\n\nThe judges at the ICJ should also go beyond the specific orders requested by the GoS, in three respects.\n\nFirst, the Court should also order the UAE to do its utmost to ensure that the RSF does not commit genocide by starvation. Article 2(c) of the Genocide Convention prohibits ‘Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.’ The RSF siege of al-Fashir and the nearby camps for internally displaced persons, and attacks on essential health facilities, have been causing mass starvation there for a year. Many people in the city and the IDP camps are from the Zaghawa ethnic group and there is good reason to believe that the RSF may be targeting them on the basis of that identity. The Court should not wait for proof that the RSF is committing genocide by starvation. It should also order the UAE to do all in its power to provide humanitarian assistance and essential services to the besieged population, both directly and through pressing the RSF to permit such assistance.\n\nAl-Burhan’s foreign ministry has denied that famine is happening in Sudan and expelled the UN’s Integrated food security Phase Classification (IPC) for determining that it is. The Court should assess the facts, including the IPC’s objective and impartial assessment.\n\nSecond, Sudan is itself bound by the Genocide Convention. The Court is required to hold the GoS to the same standards. The Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) and allied militia have committed ethnically-targeted massacres, for example in Gezira state, and there are fears of reprisals against civilians and relief workers in areas that the army captures from the RSF. The GoS has been restricting humanitarian aid to areas under RSF control, using starvation as a weapon. The provisional order for humanitarian aid should be equally binding on the GoS to prevent and punish genocide.\n\nOver the decades, SAF has a history of violations, including numerous causes plausibly described as genocide, in southern Sudan, the Nuba Mountains, and Darfur. This history is extremely salient to the current case, the most aspects of that pattern of crimes over the decades are reproduced in today’s violations. This was a point I emphasized in my testimony to the ICC, at the start of the trial of Ali Abdel Rahman ‘Kushayb’, in 2022. (The judges’ decision is expected soon.)\n\nThird, the Court should order the GoS and the UAE, and through the UAE, the RSF, to take action to prevent starvation whether or not it is directly related to the commission of genocide. The judges cannot in good conscience address a case in which the war crime of starvation is being perpetrated, and ignore those crimes, simply because they are considering a claim of genocide.\n\nHere’s some proposed language for humanitarian action:\n“Take all necessary and effective measures to ensure, without delay, in full co-operation with the United Nations, the unhindered provision at scale by all concerned of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian assistance, including food, water, electricity, fuel, shelter, clothing, hygiene and sanitation requirements, as well as medical supplies and medical care to all Sudanese, including by increasing the capacity and number of border crossing points and maintaining them open for as long as necessary.”\n\nAs mentioned, there’s a key shortcoming in any ICJ proceedings. The RSF is not a party to the ICJ. The RSF administration, called by its adversaries the ‘Republic of Kadamol’, is not a recognized state. It is not represented in the Court and the ICJ cannot directly give orders to the RSF. But the RSF aspires to government. If it is to have any political credibility, it should begin by enforcing the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide.\n\nThe ICJ can affirm the laws and principles to which all are bound, and in addressing its orders to the UAE, indicate unequivocally what the RSF needs to do.\n\nAuthor\nAlex de Waal\n\n\n",

UAE: A New Case, the Same Old Omission\n18.03.25\n|\n0 Comments\n[Luciano Pezzano is Professor of Human Rights at the University of Business and Social Sciences (UCES, Argentina) and Lecturer of Public International Law at the National University of Cordoba (UNC, Argentina)]\nOn 5 March 2025, the Republic of Sudan\ninstituted proceedings\nbefore the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against the United Arab Emirates (UAE), for breaches of the\nGenocide Convention\n. The case presents a great number of issues for legal analysis, from the value of the\nUAE’s reservation to Article IX of the Convention\n, to the issues of attribution of responsibility (and the known ICJ’s position on the effective control test), as well the notorious fact that the victims of the alleged genocide –the Masalit people– are also the same victims (with the Fur and the Zaghawa) of the alleged genocide for which the former President of Sudan, Omar Al Bashir,\nis accused before the International Criminal Court\n.\nHowever, I want to offer some thoughts about an issue that is absent in\nSudan’s Application\n: the legal consequences of genocide, as a grave breach of an obligation arising from a peremptory norm of general international law. This is not an isolated case; it seems to follow a strange pattern in all cases before the ICJ under the Genocide Convention, in which none of the Applicants asked the Court to judge and declare additional consequences for genocide, in the form of an aggravated responsibility for the responsible State or in the form of duties for third States, according the current law of State responsibility.\nIn this contribution, I will insist in the need of the determination of the consequences of genocide as a serious breach of\njus cogens\n–arguably, with aggression, the most serious– in order to reflect the hierarchic position of peremptory norms in the international legal system.\nGenocide as a Serious Breach of\njus cogens\nThere is no doubt: the prohibition of genocide is a peremptory norm. The ICJ itself has recognized it for the first time in its 2006\nJudgment\nin the\nDRC v. Rwanda\ncase (para. 64), and reiterated it, more importantly, in the\n2007 Judgment on the merits\nin the\nBosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia\ncase (para. 161). That is also the position found in the case law of other international tribunals, like the ICTY (\nProsecutor v. Jelisic\n, 14 December 1999\n, para. 60;\nProsecutor v.\nKupreškic\n, 14 January 2000\n, para. 20), or the IACtHR (\nAdvisory Opinion OC-26/20\n, para. 105). The ILC has included the prohibition of genocide in its non-exhaustive list of peremptory norms, annexed to its\n2022 Draft Conclusions on\njus cogens\n(Commentary to Draft Conclusion 23, para. 8).\nThat means that the very commission of genocide (\ni.e.\n, the violation of the obligation not to commit genocide, identified by the ICJ in its 2007 Judgment, para. 166) is a breach of a peremptory norm. Indeed, it is a serious breach by itself, under the criteria of Article 40(2) ARSIWA. In its Commentary to Article 40, the ILC pointed out: “some of the peremptory norms in question, most notably the prohibitions of aggression and genocide, by their very nature require an intentional violation on a large scale” (\nARSIWA, Commentary on Article 40, para. 8\n).\nTherefore, genocide is a serious breach of an obligation arising under a peremptory norm of international law, according to the rules of international responsibility. The logical conclusion is that the legal consequences entailed by it are those enshrined in Article 41 ARSIWA, namely: the duty of cooperation, the duties of non-recognition and not render aid or assistance, and the “other further consequences that a [serious breach] may entail under international law” (Article 41(3)).\nIt is true that the existence a regime of aggravated responsibility in international law remains as a contested topic in the legal debate, but at least the consequences enshrined in Article 41(1) and (2) are well grounded in practice and jurisprudence. The ILC reaffirmed them in its 2022 Draft Conclusions (Draft Conclusion 19), and the ICJ itself seems to have finally embraced them (although with certain overlapping or confusion with obligations\nerga omnes\n, as it did in the\nWall\nand\nChagos\nadvisory opinions) in its 2024 Advisory Opinion on the\nLegal Consequences Arising from the Policies and Practices of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory\n. It considered that the right to self-determination constitutes a peremptory norm (in cases of foreign occupation such as that case, para. 233), which was violated by Israel (para. 274), and, “in view of the character and importance of the rights and obligations involved” (para. 279), it stated that all States have the obligation to cooperate (with the United Nations, para. 275), the duty of non-recognition and the duty not to render aid or assistance (para. 279).\nEven the duty to cooperate to bring to an end serious breaches, which in 2001 was considered progressive development by the ILC, it is now recognized under international law, according to the 2022 Draft Conclusions (Commentary on Draft Conclusion 19, para. 2).\nThe Genocide Cases and a Persistent Omission\nIn its\nApplication\n, Sudan considers itself\nmindful of the\njus cogens\ncharacter of the prohibition of genocide and the\nerga omnes\nand\nerga omnes partes\ncharacter of the obligations owed by States under the Genocide Convention.\npara. 5\nHowever, the remedies that it seeks do not include additional or special consequences of genocide as a serious breach of\njus cogens\n. Instead, Sudan asks the Court for the fulfilment of the duties of cessation, reparation, and giving assurances of non-repetition by the EAU (Application, para. 68), common to all wrongful acts, according to the ARSIWA.\nAs I have pointed out in a\nprevious post on this blog\n, this is not new. In none of the contentious cases concerning genocide, the Applicants asked the Court a pronouncement on the legal consequences of that serious breach of\njus cogens\n. That was the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, The Gambia and South Africa, although all of them recognized the\njus cogens\nnature of the prohibition of genocide.\nI have to insist in my previous point: this is astounding, since genocide is –with aggression– the paradigmatic example of a serious breach of an obligation arising under a peremptory norm, and the determination of its particular consequences is an important matter of international law.\nFortunately, there is a precedent in a case on\njus cogens\nwhere the Applicants chose to ask the ICJ a pronouncement on the legal consequences of a serious breach. Although it is a case about torture under CAT, there are no legal differences on this particular issue, since gross and systematic acts of torture are, like genocide, a serious breach of a peremptory norm.\nIt is the case concerning\nApplication of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Canada and the Netherlands v. Syrian Arab Republic)\n, submitted before the ICJ on 8 June 2023. In a very short paragraph in their\nJoint Application\n, Canada and the Netherlands have requested the Court\nto adjudge and declare that Syria has committed a serious breach of a peremptory norm of international law, due to its gross or systematic failure to fulfill its obligation under Article 2 of the Convention against Torture not to commit torture as well as to prevent its officials and other persons acting in an official capacity from perpetrating acts of torture, and determine the legal consequences thereof.\nJoint Application, para. 61\nI have already underlined the\nhistorical importance of this claim\n, and\nProf. Hill-Cawthorne\nhas stressed that it would be a very welcome opportunity for the Court to clarify its views on this issue. I have also gave\nsome reasons to follow this example\nin the cases currently pending before the ICJ, but now I want to share some thoughts on the issue underlying this position.\nJus cogens\nand the Need of a Special Regime of International Responsibility\nWhat is the point of asserting the\njus cogens\nnature of a norm by one hand, and not to claim additional consequences for its breach by the other? If they do not have special consequences in the field of international responsibility, what is the meaning of the very notion of peremptory norms? Restricting their function to the Law of Treaties (Articles 53 and 64 of the Vienna Convention) seems incompatible with its position in international law. Already in 1976, Roberto Ago, in his seminal\nfifth report on State responsibility\n, held:\nit would seem contradictory if the same consequences continued to be applied to the breach of obligations arising out of the rules defined as ‘imperative’ and the breach of obligations arising out of rules from which derogation through particular agreements is permitted.\npara. 99\nOne could argue that the effect of\njus cogens\nin international responsibility is the widening of the right to invoke responsibility, since all States have a legal interest in compliance with them. However, this is an effect of the\nerga omnes\nnature of the obligations arising from peremptory norms, which is a closely related, but different concept in international law (see the ILC Draft Conclusion 17).\nThe importance of peremptory norms in international law and the seriousness of their breaches requires a different regime of international responsibility, with additional consequences for the responsible State and for the international community as a whole. The ILC understood this difference in its commentary to the famous Article 19 of its draft on international responsibility:\nthe establishment of a distinction between internationally wrongful acts, based on the difference in importance—for the international community as a whole—of the subject-matter of the obligations breached, and at the same time of the extent of the breaches, will necessarily be reflected in the legal consequences attached to the internationally wrongful acts falling into one or the other of the two categories.\nILC Yearbook 1976, Vol. II, part 2\n, p. 97\nTwenty-five year later, in the commentary to Chapter III of Part Two of ARSIWA, the ILC addressed this issue:\nthere are certain consequences flowing from the basic concepts of peremptory norms of general international law and obligations to the international community as a whole within the field of State responsibility. […] serious breaches of obligations arising under peremptory norms of general international law can attract additional consequences, not only for the responsible State but for all other States.\nILC Yearbook 2001, Vol. II, part 2\n, pp. 110-111\nThis is not a mere theoretical issue: serious breaches of peremptory norms entail additional consequences in the field of international responsibility because their importance to the international community as a whole. As the ILC Draft Conclusion 2 states, peremptory norms “reflect and protect fundamental values of the international community. They are universally applicable and are hierarchically superior to other rules of international law.” This hierarchical superiority has an impact in the rules of international responsibility. Judge Cançado Trindade was particularly aware of this impact in his Reasoned Opinion in the\nJudgment of the Inter-American Court in the\nCase of Myrna Mack Chang v. Guatemala\n:\nwhen the international community professes certain fundamental and higher values, it is necessary to accept the consequence of establishment of a special regime of aggravated responsibility (associated with crimes of State) insofar as there are abridgments of said values or of the rules that protect them.\npara. 30\nFinal Remarks\nI understand that the\nSudan v. UAE\ncase is complex enough to adding new layers of discussion. Its future is uncertain, mainly due to the jurisdictional issues arising the UAE’s reservation to Article IX of the Convention, but the case is useful as a reminder of the need to taking account the legal consequences of genocide, and of serious breaches of\njus cogens\nin general. When a State brings a case before an international court on a matter as serious as genocide must know that there are fundamental rules and values at stake. The importance of those rules requires an adequate treatment in the pleadings of the consequences of serious breaches of peremptory norms. That would give the ICJ an opportunity to clarify this issue, and to develop further the regime of international responsibility regarding\njus cogens\n.\nTopics\nAfrica\n,\nFeatured\n,\nGeneral\n,\nMiddle East\n,\nPublic International Law\nShare\nEmail\nTwitter\nFacebook\nLinkedIn\nWhatsApp\nPrint\nTags:\nGenocide Convention\n,\nICJ\n,\nJus Cogens\nRelated\nLeave a Reply\nPlease\nLogin\nto comment\nThis comment form is under antispam protection\nThis comment form is under antispam protection\nSubscribe\nNotify of\nnew follow-up comments\nnew replies to my comments\nAbout Author\nLuciano Pezzano\nRecent Posts\nDe-Christianizing International Law: US Politics and the Evangelical Legacy\nJustified Disobedience?

    "cleaned_text_content": "The jus cogens Nature of the Prohibition of Genocide in Sudan v. UAE: A New Case, the Same Old Omission\n\n[Luciano Pezzano is Professor of Human Rights at the University of Business and Social Sciences (UCES, Argentina) and Lecturer of Public International Law at the National University of Cordoba (UNC, Argentina)]\n\nOn 5 March 2025, the Republic of Sudan instituted proceedings before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against the United Arab Emirates (UAE), for breaches of the Genocide Convention. The case presents a great number of issues for legal analysis, from the value of the UAE’s reservation to Article IX of the Convention, to the issues of attribution of responsibility (and the known ICJ’s position on the effective control test), as well the notorious fact that the victims of the alleged genocide –the Masalit people– are also the same victims (with the Fur and the Zaghawa) of the alleged genocide for which the former President of Sudan, Omar Al Bashir, is accused before the International Criminal Court.\n\nHowever, I want to offer some thoughts about an issue that is absent in Sudan’s Application: the legal consequences of genocide, as a grave breach of an obligation arising from a peremptory norm of general international law. This is not an isolated case; it seems to follow a strange pattern in all cases before the ICJ under the Genocide Convention, in which none of the Applicants asked the Court to judge and declare additional consequences for genocide, in the form of an aggravated responsibility for the responsible State or in the form of duties for third States, according the current law of State responsibility.\n\nIn this contribution, I will insist in the need of the determination of the consequences of genocide as a serious breach of jus cogens –arguably, with aggression, the most serious– in order to reflect the hierarchic position of peremptory norms in the international legal system.\n\nGenocide as a Serious Breach of jus cogens\n\nThere is no doubt: the prohibition of genocide is a peremptory norm. The ICJ itself has recognized it for the first time in its 2006 Judgment in the DRC v. Rwanda case (para. 64), and reiterated it, more importantly, in the 2007 Judgment on the merits in the Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia case (para. 161). That is also the position found in the case law of other international tribunals, like the ICTY (Prosecutor v. Jelisic, 14 December 1999, para. 60; Prosecutor v. Kupreškic, 14 January 2000, para. 20), or the IACtHR (Advisory Opinion OC-26/20, para. 105). The ILC has included the prohibition of genocide in its non-exhaustive list of peremptory norms, annexed to its 2022 Draft Conclusions on jus cogens (Commentary to Draft Conclusion 23, para. 8).\n\nThat means that the very commission of genocide (i.e., the violation of the obligation not to commit genocide, identified by the ICJ in its 2007 Judgment, para. 166) is a breach of a peremptory norm. Indeed, it is a serious breach by itself, under the criteria of Article 40(2) ARSIWA. In its Commentary to Article 40, the ILC pointed out: “some of the peremptory norms in question, most notably the prohibitions of aggression and genocide, by their very nature require an intentional violation on a large scale” (ARSIWA, Commentary on Article 40, para. 8).\n\nTherefore, genocide is a serious breach of an obligation arising under a peremptory norm of international law, according to the rules of international responsibility. The logical conclusion is that the legal consequences entailed by it are those enshrined in Article 41 ARSIWA, namely: the duty of cooperation, the duties of non-recognition and not render aid or assistance, and the “other further consequences that a [serious breach] may entail under international law” (Article 41(3)).\n\n\nIt is true that the existence a regime of aggravated responsibility in international law remains as a contested topic in the legal debate, but at least the consequences enshrined in Article 41(1) and (2) are well grounded in practice and jurisprudence. The ILC reaffirmed them in its 2022 Draft Conclusions (Draft Conclusion 19), and the ICJ itself seems to have finally embraced them (although with certain overlapping or confusion with obligations erga omnes, as it did in the Wall and Chagos advisory opinions) in its 2024 Advisory Opinion on the Legal Consequences Arising from the Policies and Practices of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It considered that the right to self-determination constitutes a peremptory norm (in cases of foreign occupation such as that case, para. 233), which was violated by Israel (para. 274), and, “in view of the character and importance of the rights and obligations involved” (para. 279), it stated that all States have the obligation to cooperate (with the United Nations, para. 275), the duty of non-recognition and the duty not to render aid or assistance (para. 279).\n\nEven the duty to cooperate to bring to an end serious breaches, which in 2001 was considered progressive development by the ILC, it is now recognized under international law, according to the 2022 Draft Conclusions (Commentary on Draft Conclusion 19, para. 2).\n\nThe Genocide Cases and a Persistent Omission\n\nIn its Application, Sudan considers itself mindful of the jus cogens character of the prohibition of genocide and the erga omnes and erga omnes partes character of the obligations owed by States under the Genocide Convention. para. 5\n\nHowever, the remedies that it seeks do not include additional or special consequences of genocide as a serious breach of jus cogens. Instead, Sudan asks the Court for the fulfilment of the duties of cessation, reparation, and giving assurances of non-repetition by the EAU (Application, para. 68), common to all wrongful acts, according to the ARSIWA.\n\nAs I have pointed out in a previous post on this blog, this is not new. In none of the contentious cases concerning genocide, the Applicants asked the Court a pronouncement on the legal consequences of that serious breach of jus cogens. That was the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, The Gambia and South Africa, although all of them recognized the jus cogens nature of the prohibition of genocide.\n\nI have to insist in my previous point: this is astounding, since genocide is –with aggression– the paradigmatic example of a serious breach of an obligation arising under a peremptory norm, and the determination of its particular consequences is an important matter of international law.\n\nFortunately, there is a precedent in a case on jus cogens where the Applicants chose to ask the ICJ a pronouncement on the legal consequences of a serious breach. Although it is a case about torture under CAT, there are no legal differences on this particular issue, since gross and systematic acts of torture are, like genocide, a serious breach of a peremptory norm.\n\nIt is the case concerning Application of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (Canada and the Netherlands v. Syrian Arab Republic), submitted before the ICJ on 8 June 2023. In a very short paragraph in their Joint Application, Canada and the Netherlands have requested the Court to adjudge and declare that Syria has committed a serious breach of a peremptory norm of international law, due to its gross or systematic failure to fulfill its obligation under Article 2 of the Convention against Torture not to commit torture as well as to prevent its officials and other persons acting in an official capacity from perpetrating acts of torture, and determine the legal consequences thereof. Joint Application, para. 61\n\nI have already underlined the historical importance of this claim, and Prof. Hill-Cawthorne has stressed that it would be a very welcome opportunity for the Court to clarify its views on this issue. I have also gave some reasons to follow this example in the cases currently pending before the ICJ, but now I want to share some thoughts on the issue underlying this position.\n\nJus cogens and the Need of a Special Regime of International Responsibility\n\nWhat is the point of asserting the jus cogens nature of a norm by one hand, and not to claim additional consequences for its breach by the other? If they do not have special consequences in the field of international responsibility, what is the meaning of the very notion of peremptory norms? Restricting their function to the Law of Treaties (Articles 53 and 64 of the Vienna Convention) seems incompatible with its position in international law. Already in 1976, Roberto Ago, in his seminal fifth report on State responsibility, held: it would seem contradictory if the same consequences continued to be applied to the breach of obligations arising out of the rules defined as ‘imperative’ and the breach of obligations arising out of rules from which derogation through particular agreements is permitted. para. 99\n\nOne could argue that the effect of jus cogens in international responsibility is the widening of the right to invoke responsibility, since all States have a legal interest in compliance with them. However, this is an effect of the erga omnes nature of the obligations arising from peremptory norms, which is a closely related, but different concept in international law (see the ILC Draft Conclusion 17).\n\nThe importance of peremptory norms in international law and the seriousness of their breaches requires a different regime of international responsibility, with additional consequences for the responsible State and for the international community as a whole. The ILC understood this difference in its commentary to the famous Article 19 of its draft on international responsibility: the establishment of a distinction between internationally wrongful acts, based on the difference in importance—for the international community as a whole—of the subject-matter of the obligations breached, and at the same time of the extent of the breaches, will necessarily be reflected in the legal consequences attached to the internationally wrongful acts falling into one or the other of the two categories. ILC Yearbook 1976, Vol. II, part 2, p. 97\n\nTwenty-five year later, in the commentary to Chapter III of Part Two of ARSIWA, the ILC addressed this issue: there are certain consequences flowing from the basic concepts of peremptory norms of general international law and obligations to the international community as a whole within the field of State responsibility. […] serious breaches of obligations arising under peremptory norms of general international law can attract additional consequences, not only for the responsible State but for all other States. ILC Yearbook 2001, Vol. II, part 2, pp. 110-111\n\nThis is not a mere theoretical issue: serious breaches of peremptory norms entail additional consequences in the field of international responsibility because their importance to the international community as a whole. As the ILC Draft Conclusion 2 states, peremptory norms “reflect and protect fundamental values of the international community. They are universally applicable and are hierarchically superior to other rules of international law.” This hierarchical superiority has an impact in the rules of international responsibility. Judge Cançado Trindade was particularly aware of this impact in his Reasoned Opinion in the Judgment of the Inter-American Court in the Case of Myrna Mack Chang v. Guatemala: when the international community professes certain fundamental and higher values, it is necessary to accept the consequence of establishment of a special regime of aggravated responsibility (associated with crimes of State) insofar as there are abridgments of said values or of the rules that protect them. para. 30\n\nFinal Remarks\n\nI understand that the Sudan v. UAE case is complex enough to adding new layers of discussion. Its future is uncertain, mainly due to the jurisdictional issues arising the UAE’s reservation to Article IX of the Convention, but the case is useful as a reminder of the need to taking account the legal consequences of genocide, and of serious breaches of jus cogens in general. When a State brings a case before an international court on a matter as serious as genocide must know that there are fundamental rules and values at stake. The importance of those rules requires an adequate treatment in the pleadings of the consequences of serious breaches of peremptory norms. That would give the ICJ an opportunity to clarify this issue, and to develop further the regime of international responsibility regarding jus cogens.\n",
